But,thou,contracted,to,thine,own,bright,eyes,
Feed'st,thy,light,'s,flame,with,self-substantial,fuel,
Making,a,famine,where,abundance,lies,
Thy,self,thy,foe,to,thy,sweet,self,too,cruel,

Then,being,asked,where,all,thy,beauty,lies,
Where,all,the,treasure,of,thy,lusty,days,
To,say,within,thine,own,deep,sunken,eyes,
Were,an,all-eating,shame,and,thriftless,praise,

For,where,is,she,so,fair,whose,uneared,womb,
Disdains,the,tillage,of,thy,husbandry,
Or,who,is,he,so,fond,will,be,the,tomb,
Of,his,self-love,to,stop,posterity,

Then,beauteous,niggard,why,dost,thou,abuse,
The,bounteous,largess,given,thee,to,give,
Profitless,usurer,why,dost,thou,use,
So,great,a,sum,of,sums,yet,canst,not,live,

For,never-resting,time,leads,summer,on,
To,hideous,winter,and,confounds,him,there,
Sap,checked,with,frost,and,lusty,leaves,quite,gone,
Beauty,o'er-snowed,and,bareness,every,where,

That,use,is,not,forbidden,usury,
Which,happies,those,that,pay,the,willing,loan,
That,'s,for,thy,self,to,breed,another,thee,
Or,ten,times,happier,be,it,ten,for,one,

And,having,climbed,the,steep-up,heavenly,hill,
Resembling,strong,youth,in,his,middle,age,
Yet,mortal,looks,adore,his,beauty,still,
Attending,on,his,golden,pilgrimage,

If,the,true,concord,of,well-tuned,sounds,
By,unions,married,do,offend,thine,ear,
They,do,but,sweetly,chide,thee,who,confounds,
In,singleness,the,parts,that,thou,shouldst,bear,

The,world,will,be,thy,widow,and,still,weep,
That,thou,no,form,of,thee,hast,left,behind,
When,every,private,widow,well,may,keep,
By,children,'s,eyes,her,husband,'s,shape,in,mind,

For,thou,art,so,possessed,with,murd'rous,hate,
That,'gainst,thy,self,thou,stick'st,not,to,conspire,
Seeking,that,beauteous,roof,to,ruinate,
Which,to,repair,should,be,thy,chief,desire,

Herein,lives,wisdom,beauty,and,increase,
Without,this,folly,age,and,cold,decay,
If,all,were,minded,so,the,times,should,cease,
And,threescore,year,would,make,the,world,away,

When,lofty,trees,I,see,barren,of,leaves,
Which,erst,from,heat,did,canopy,the,herd,
And,summer,'s,green,all,girded,up,in,sheaves,
Borne,on,the,bier,with,white,and,bristly,beard,

So,should,that,beauty,which,you,hold,in,lease,
Find,no,determination,then,you,were,
Your,self,again,after,your,self,'s,decease,
When,your,sweet,issue,your,sweet,form,should,bear,

Nor,can,I,fortune,to,brief,minutes,tell,
Pointing,to,each,his,thunder,rain,and,wind,
Or,say,with,princes,if,it,shall,go,well,
By,oft,predict,that,I,in,heaven,find,

When,I,perceive,that,men,as,plants,increase,
Cheered,and,checked,even,by,the,self-same,sky,
Vaunt,in,their,youthful,sap,at,height,decrease,
And,wear,their,brave,state,out,of,memory,

Now,stand,you,on,the,top,of,happy,hours,
And,many,maiden,gardens,yet,unset,
With,virtuous,wish,would,bear,you,living,flowers,
Much,liker,than,your,painted,counterfeit,

If,I,could,write,the,beauty,of,your,eyes,
And,in,fresh,numbers,number,all,your,graces,
The,age,to,come,would,say,this,poet,lies,
Such,heavenly,touches,ne'er,touched,earthly,faces,

Sometime,too,hot,the,eye,of,heaven,shines,
And,often,is,his,gold,complexion,dimmed,
And,every,fair,from,fair,sometime,declines,
By,chance,or,nature,'s,changing,course,untrimmed,

Make,glad,and,sorry,seasons,as,thou,fleet'st,
And,do,whate'er,thou,wilt,swift-footed,Time,
To,the,wide,world,and,all,her,fading,sweets,
But,I,forbid,thee,one,most,heinous,crime,

An,eye,more,bright,than,theirs,less,false,in,rolling,
Gilding,the,object,whereupon,it,gazeth,
A,man,in,hue,all,hues,in,his,controlling,
Which,steals,men,'s,eyes,and,women,'s,souls,amazeth,

Making,a,couplement,of,proud,compare,
With,sun,and,moon,with,earth,and,sea,'s,rich,gems,
With,April,'s,first-born,flowers,and,all,things,rare,
That,heaven,'s,air,in,this,huge,rondure,hems,

For,all,that,beauty,that,doth,cover,thee,
Is,but,the,seemly,raiment,of,my,heart,
Which,in,thy,breast,doth,live,as,thine,in,me,
How,can,I,then,be,elder,than,thou,art,

So,I,for,fear,of,trust,forget,to,say,
The,perfect,ceremony,of,love,'s,rite,
And,in,mine,own,love,'s,strength,seem,to,decay,
O'ercharged,with,burthen,of,mine,own,love,'s,might,

For,through,the,painter,must,you,see,his,skill,
To,find,where,your,true,image,pictured,lies,
Which,in,my,bosom,'s,shop,is,hanging,still,
That,hath,his,windows,glazed,with,thine,eyes,

Great,princes,favourites,their,fair,leaves,spread,
But,as,the,marigold,at,the,sun,'s,eye,
And,in,themselves,their,pride,lies,buried,
For,at,a,frown,they,in,their,glory,die,

Duty,so,great,which,wit,so,poor,as,mine,
May,make,seem,bare,in,wanting,words,to,show,it,
But,that,I,hope,some,good,conceit,of,thine,
In,thy,soul,'s,thought,all,naked,will,bestow,it,

For,then,my,thoughts,from,far,where,I,abide,
Intend,a,zealous,pilgrimage,to,thee,
And,keep,my,drooping,eyelids,open,wide,
Looking,on,darkness,which,the,blind,do,see,

And,each,though,enemies,to,either,'s,reign,
Do,in,consent,shake,hands,to,torture,me,
The,one,by,toil,the,other,to,complain,
How,far,I,toil,still,farther,off,from,thee,

Wishing,me,like,to,one,more,rich,in,hope,
Featured,like,him,like,him,with,friends,possessed,
Desiring,this,man,'s,art,and,that,man,'s,scope,
With,what,I,most,enjoy,contented,least,

Then,can,I,drown,an,eye,unused,to,flow,
For,precious,friends,hid,in,death,'s,dateless,night,
And,weep,afresh,love,'s,long,since,cancelled,woe,
And,moan,th,expense,of,many,a,vanished,sight,

How,many,a,holy,and,obsequious,tear,
Hath,dear,religious,love,stol'n,from,mine,eye,
As,interest,of,the,dead,which,now,appear,
But,things,removed,that,hidden,in,thee,lie,

Compare,them,with,the,bett'ring,of,the,time,
And,though,they,be,outstripped,by,every,pen,
Reserve,them,for,my,love,not,for,their,rhyme,
Exceeded,by,the,height,of,happier,men,

Anon,permit,the,basest,clouds,to,ride,
With,ugly,rack,on,his,celestial,face,
And,from,the,forlorn,world,his,visage,hide,
Stealing,unseen,to,west,with,this,disgrace,

'T,is,not,enough,that,through,the,cloud,thou,break,
To,dry,the,rain,on,my,storm-beaten,face,
For,no,man,well,of,such,a,salve,can,speak,
That,heals,the,wound,and,cures,not,the,disgrace,

All,men,make,faults,and,even,I,in,this,
Authorizing,thy,trespass,with,compare,
My,self,corrupting,salving,thy,amiss,
Excusing,thy,sins,more,than,thy,sins,are,

In,our,two,loves,there,is,but,one,respect,
Though,in,our,lives,a,separable,spite,
Which,though,it,alter,not,love,'s,sole,effect,
Yet,doth,it,steal,sweet,hours,from,love,'s,delight,

For,whether,beauty,birth,or,wealth,or,wit,
Or,any,of,these,all,or,all,or,more,
Entitled,in,thy,parts,do,crowned,sit,
I,make,my,love,engrafted,to,this,store,

O,give,thy,self,the,thanks,if,aught,in,me,
Worthy,perusal,stand,against,thy,sight,
For,who,'s,so,dumb,that,can,not,write,to,thee,
When,thou,thy,self,dost,give,invention,light,

Even,for,this,let,us,divided,live,
And,our,dear,love,lose,name,of,single,one,
That,by,this,separation,I,may,give,
That,due,to,thee,which,thou,deserv'st,alone,

Then,if,for,my,love,thou,my,love,receivest,
I,can,not,blame,thee,for,my,love,thou,usest,
But,yet,be,blamed,if,thou,thy,self,deceivest,
By,wilful,taste,of,what,thy,self,refusest,

Gentle,thou,art,and,therefore,to,be,won,
Beauteous,thou,art,therefore,to,be,assailed,
And,when,a,woman,woos,what,woman,'s,son,
Will,sourly,leave,her,till,he,have,prevailed,

Loving,offenders,thus,I,will,excuse,ye,
Thou,dost,love,her,because,thou,know'st,I,love,her,
And,for,my,sake,even,so,doth,she,abuse,me,
Suff'ring,my,friend,for,my,sake,to,approve,her,

Then,thou,whose,shadow,shadows,doth,make,bright,
How,would,thy,shadow,'s,form,form,happy,show,
To,the,clear,day,with,thy,much,clearer,light,
When,to,unseeing,eyes,thy,shade,shines,so,

No,matter,then,although,my,foot,did,stand,
Upon,the,farthest,earth,removed,from,thee,
For,nimble,thought,can,jump,both,sea,and,land,
As,soon,as,think,the,place,where,he,would,be,

For,when,these,quicker,elements,are,gone,
In,tender,embassy,of,love,to,thee,
My,life,being,made,of,four,with,two,alone,
Sinks,down,to,death,oppressed,with,melancholy,

My,heart,doth,plead,that,thou,in,him,dost,lie,
A,closet,never,pierced,with,crystal,eyes,
But,the,defendant,doth,that,plea,deny,
And,says,in,him,thy,fair,appearance,lies,

With,my,love,'s,picture,then,my,eye,doth,feast,
And,to,the,painted,banquet,bids,my,heart,
Another,time,mine,eye,is,my,heart,'s,guest,
And,in,his,thoughts,of,love,doth,share,a,part,

But,thou,to,whom,my,jewels,trifles,are,
Most,worthy,comfort,now,my,greatest,grief,
Thou,best,of,dearest,and,mine,only,care,
Art,left,the,prey,of,every,vulgar,thief,

Against,that,time,when,thou,shalt,strangely,pass,
And,scarcely,greet,me,with,that,sun,thine,eye,
When,love,converted,from,the,thing,it,was,
Shall,reasons,find,of,settled,gravity,

The,beast,that,bears,me,tired,with,my,woe,
Plods,dully,on,to,bear,that,weight,in,me,
As,if,by,some,instinct,the,wretch,did,know,
His,rider,loved,not,speed,being,made,from,thee,

O,what,excuse,will,my,poor,beast,then,find,
When,swift,extremity,can,seem,but,slow,
Then,should,I,spur,though,mounted,on,the,wind,
In,winged,speed,no,motion,shall,I,know,

Therefore,are,feasts,so,solemn,and,so,rare,
Since,seldom,coming,in,that,long,year,set,
Like,stones,of,worth,they,thinly,placed,are,
Or,captain,jewels,in,the,carcanet,

Describe,Adonis,and,the,counterfeit,
Is,poorly,imitated,after,you,
On,Helen,'s,cheek,all,art,of,beauty,set,
And,you,in,Grecian,tires,are,painted,new,

The,canker,blooms,have,full,as,deep,a,dye,
As,the,perfumed,tincture,of,the,roses,
Hang,on,such,thorns,and,play,as,wantonly,
When,summer,'s,breath,their,masked,buds,discloses,

When,wasteful,war,shall,statues,overturn,
And,broils,root,out,the,work,of,masonry,
Nor,Mars,his,sword,nor,war,'s,quick,fire,shall,burn,
The,living,record,of,your,memory,

So,love,be,thou,although,to-day,thou,fill,
Thy,hungry,eyes,even,till,they,wink,with,fulness,
To-morrow,see,again,and,do,not,kill,
The,spirit,of,love,with,a,perpetual,dulness,

Nor,dare,I,chide,the,world-without-end,hour,
Whilst,I,my,sovereign,watch,the,clock,for,you,
Nor,think,the,bitterness,of,absence,sour,
When,you,have,bid,your,servant,once,adieu,

O,let,me,suffer,being,at,your,beck,
Th,imprisoned,absence,of,your,liberty,
And,patience,tame,to,sufferance,bide,each,check,
Without,accusing,you,of,injury,

O,that,record,could,with,a,backward,look,
Even,of,five,hundred,courses,of,the,sun,
Show,me,your,image,in,some,antique,book,
Since,mind,at,first,in,character,was,done,

Nativity,once,in,the,main,of,light,
Crawls,to,maturity,wherewith,being,crowned,
Crooked,eclipses,'gainst,his,glory,fight,
And,Time,that,gave,doth,now,his,gift,confound,

Is,it,thy,spirit,that,thou,send'st,from,thee,
So,far,from,home,into,my,deeds,to,pry,
To,find,out,shames,and,idle,hours,in,me,
The,scope,and,tenure,of,thy,jealousy,

Methinks,no,face,so,gracious,is,as,mine,
No,shape,so,true,no,truth,of,such,account,
And,for,my,self,mine,own,worth,do,define,
As,I,all,other,in,all,worths,surmount,

Hath,travelled,on,to,age,'s,steepy,night,
And,all,those,beauties,whereof,now,he,'s,king,
Are,vanishing,or,vanished,out,of,sight,
Stealing,away,the,treasure,of,his,spring,

When,I,have,seen,the,hungry,ocean,gain,
Advantage,on,the,kingdom,of,the,shore,
And,the,firm,soil,win,of,the,watery,main,
Increasing,store,with,loss,and,loss,with,store,

O,how,shall,summer,'s,honey,breath,hold,out,
Against,the,wrackful,siege,of,batt'ring,days,
When,rocks,impregnable,are,not,so,stout,
Nor,gates,of,steel,so,strong,but,time,decays,

And,gilded,honour,shamefully,misplaced,
And,maiden,virtue,rudely,strumpeted,
And,right,perfection,wrongfully,disgraced,
And,strength,by,limping,sway,disabled,

Why,should,false,painting,imitate,his,cheek,
And,steal,dead,seeming,of,his,living,hue,
Why,should,poor,beauty,indirectly,seek,
Roses,of,shadow,since,his,rose,is,true,

Before,the,golden,tresses,of,the,dead,
The,right,of,sepulchres,were,shorn,away,
To,live,a,second,life,on,second,head,
Ere,beauty,'s,dead,fleece,made,another,gay,

Thy,outward,thus,with,outward,praise,is,crowned,
But,those,same,tongues,that,give,thee,so,thine,own,
In,other,accents,do,this,praise,confound,
By,seeing,farther,than,the,eye,hath,shown,

So,thou,be,good,slander,doth,but,approve,
Thy,worth,the,greater,being,wooed,of,time,
For,canker,vice,the,sweetest,buds,doth,love,
And,thou,present'st,a,pure,unstained,prime,

Nay,if,you,read,this,line,remember,not,
The,hand,that,writ,it,for,I,love,you,so,
That,I,in,your,sweet,thoughts,would,be,forgot,
If,thinking,on,me,then,should,make,you,woe,

Unless,you,would,devise,some,virtuous,lie,
To,do,more,for,me,than,mine,own,desert,
And,hang,more,praise,upon,deceased,I,
Than,niggard,truth,would,willingly,impart,

In,me,thou,seest,the,twilight,of,such,day,
As,after,sunset,fadeth,in,the,west,
Which,by,and,by,black,night,doth,take,away,
Death,'s,second,self,that,seals,up,all,in,rest,

When,thou,reviewest,this,thou,dost,review,
The,very,part,was,consecrate,to,thee,
The,earth,can,have,but,earth,which,is,his,due,
My,spirit,is,thine,the,better,part,of,me,

Now,proud,as,an,enjoyer,and,anon,
Doubting,the,filching,age,will,steal,his,treasure,
Now,counting,best,to,be,with,you,alone,
Then,bettered,that,the,world,may,see,my,pleasure,

Why,write,I,still,all,one,ever,the,same,
And,keep,invention,in,a,noted,weed,
That,every,word,doth,almost,tell,my,name,
Showing,their,birth,and,where,they,did,proceed,

The,wrinkles,which,thy,glass,will,truly,show,
Of,mouthed,graves,will,give,thee,memory,
Thou,by,thy,dial,'s,shady,stealth,mayst,know,
Time,'s,thievish,progress,to,eternity,

Thine,eyes,that,taught,the,dumb,on,high,to,sing,
And,heavy,ignorance,aloft,to,fly,
Have,added,feathers,to,the,learned,'s,wing,
And,given,grace,a,double,majesty,

I,grant,sweet,love,thy,lovely,argument,
Deserves,the,travail,of,a,worthier,pen,
Yet,what,of,thee,thy,poet,doth,invent,
He,robs,thee,of,and,pays,it,thee,again,

But,since,your,worth,wide,as,the,ocean,is,
The,humble,as,the,proudest,sail,doth,bear,
My,saucy,bark,inferior,far,to,his,
On,your,broad,main,doth,wilfully,appear,

Your,name,from,hence,immortal,life,shall,have,
Though,I,once,gone,to,all,the,world,must,die,
The,earth,can,yield,me,but,a,common,grave,
When,you,entombed,in,men,'s,eyes,shall,lie,

Thou,art,as,fair,in,knowledge,as,in,hue,
Finding,thy,worth,a,limit,past,my,praise,
And,therefore,art,enforced,to,seek,anew,
Some,fresher,stamp,of,the,time-bettering,days,

And,therefore,have,I,slept,in,your,report,
That,you,your,self,being,extant,well,might,show,
How,far,a,modern,quill,doth,come,too,short,
Speaking,of,worth,what,worth,in,you,doth,grow,

Lean,penury,within,that,pen,doth,dwell,
That,to,his,subject,lends,not,some,small,glory,
But,he,that,writes,of,you,if,he,can,tell,
That,you,are,you,so,dignifies,his,story,

I,think,good,thoughts,whilst,other,write,good,words,
And,like,unlettered,clerk,still,cry,Amen,
To,every,hymn,that,able,spirit,affords,
In,polished,form,of,well,refined,pen,

Was,it,his,spirit,by,spirits,taught,to,write,
Above,a,mortal,pitch,that,struck,me,dead,
No,neither,he,nor,his,compeers,by,night,
Giving,him,aid,my,verse,astonished,

For,how,do,I,hold,thee,but,by,thy,granting,
And,for,that,riches,where,is,my,deserving,
The,cause,of,this,fair,gift,in,me,is,wanting,
And,so,my,patent,back,again,is,swerving,

With,mine,own,weakness,being,best,acquainted,
Upon,thy,part,I,can,set,down,a,story,
Of,faults,concealed,wherein,I,am,attainted,
That,thou,in,losing,me,shalt,win,much,glory,

Thou,canst,not,love,disgrace,me,half,so,ill,
To,set,a,form,upon,desired,change,
As,I,'ll,my,self,disgrace,knowing,thy,will,
I,will,acquaintance,strangle,and,look,strange,

Ah,do,not,when,my,heart,hath,'scaped,this,sorrow,
Come,in,the,rearward,of,a,conquered,woe,
Give,not,a,windy,night,a,rainy,morrow,
To,linger,out,a,purposed,overthrow,

And,every,humour,hath,his,adjunct,pleasure,
Wherein,it,finds,a,joy,above,the,rest,
But,these,particulars,are,not,my,measure,
All,these,I,better,in,one,general,best,

Then,need,I,not,to,fear,the,worst,of,wrongs,
When,in,the,least,of,them,my,life,hath,end,
I,see,a,better,state,to,me,belongs,
Than,that,which,on,thy,humour,doth,depend,

For,there,can,live,no,hatred,in,thine,eye,
Therefore,in,that,I,can,not,know,thy,change,
In,many,'s,looks,the,false,heart,'s,history,
Is,writ,in,moods,and,frowns,and,wrinkles,strange,

They,rightly,do,inherit,heaven,'s,graces,
And,husband,nature,'s,riches,from,expense,
Tibey,are,the,lords,and,owners,of,their,faces,
Others,but,stewards,of,their,excellence,

That,tongue,that,tells,the,story,of,thy,days,
Making,lascivious,comments,on,thy,sport,
Can,not,dispraise,but,in,a,kind,of,praise,
Naming,thy,name,blesses,an,ill,report,

As,on,the,finger,of,a,throned,queen,
The,basest,jewel,will,be,well,esteemed,
So,are,those,errors,that,in,thee,are,seen,
To,truths,translated,and,for,true,things,deemed,

And,yet,this,time,removed,was,summer,'s,time,
The,teeming,autumn,big,with,rich,increase,
Bearing,the,wanton,burden,of,the,prime,
Like,widowed,wombs,after,their,lords,decease,

Yet,nor,the,lays,of,birds,nor,the,sweet,smell,
Of,different,flowers,in,odour,and,in,hue,
Could,make,me,any,summer,'s,story,tell,
Or,from,their,proud,lap,pluck,them,where,they,grew,

In,my,love,'s,veins,thou,hast,too,grossly,dyed,
The,lily,I,condemned,for,thy,hand,
And,buds,of,marjoram,had,stol'n,thy,hair,
The,roses,fearfully,on,thorns,did,stand,

Return,forgetful,Muse,and,straight,redeem,
In,gentle,numbers,time,so,idly,spent,
Sing,to,the,ear,that,doth,thy,lays,esteem,
And,gives,thy,pen,both,skill,and,argument,

Make,answer,Muse,wilt,thou,not,haply,say,
'Truth,needs,no,colour,with,his,colour,fixed,
Beauty,no,pencil,beauty,'s,truth,to,lay,
But,best,is,best,if,never,intermixed,?,

Our,love,was,new,and,then,but,in,the,spring,
When,I,was,wont,to,greet,it,with,my,lays,
As,Philomel,in,summer,'s,front,doth,sing,
And,stops,her,pipe,in,growth,of,riper,days,

O,blame,me,not,if,I,no,more,can,write,
Look,in,your,glass,and,there,appears,a,face,
That,over-goes,my,blunt,invention,quite,
Dulling,my,lines,and,doing,me,disgrace,

Three,beauteous,springs,to,yellow,autumn,turned,
In,process,of,the,seasons,have,I,seen,
Three,April,perfumes,in,three,hot,Junes,burned,
Since,first,I,saw,you,fresh,which,yet,are,green,

Kind,is,my,love,to-day,to-morrow,kind,
Still,constant,in,a,wondrous,excellence,
Therefore,my,verse,to,constancy,confined,
One,thing,expressing,leaves,out,difference,

Then,in,the,blazon,of,sweet,beauty,'s,best,
Of,hand,of,foot,of,lip,of,eye,of,brow,
I,see,their,antique,pen,would,have,expressed,
Even,such,a,beauty,as,you,master,now,

The,mortal,moon,hath,her,eclipse,endured,
And,the,sad,augurs,mock,their,own,presage,
Incertainties,now,crown,themselves,assured,
And,peace,proclaims,olives,of,endless,age,

Nothing,sweet,boy,but,yet,like,prayers,divine,
I,must,each,day,say,o'er,the,very,same,
Counting,no,old,thing,old,thou,mine,I,thine,
Even,as,when,first,I,hallowed,thy,fair,name,

That,is,my,home,of,love,if,I,have,ranged,
Like,him,that,travels,I,return,again,
Just,to,the,time,not,with,the,time,exchanged,
So,that,my,self,bring,water,for,my,stain,

Most,true,it,is,that,I,have,looked,on,truth,
Askance,and,strangely,but,by,all,above,
These,blenches,gave,my,heart,another,youth,
And,worse,essays,proved,thee,my,best,of,love,

Thence,comes,it,that,my,name,receives,a,brand,
And,almost,thence,my,nature,is,subdued,
To,what,it,works,in,like,the,dyer,'s,hand,
Pity,me,then,and,wish,I,were,renewed,

You,are,my,all,the,world,and,I,must,strive,
To,know,my,shames,and,praises,from,your,tongue,
None,else,to,me,nor,I,to,none,alive,
That,my,steeled,sense,or,changes,right,or,wrong,

For,it,no,form,delivers,to,the,heart,
Of,bird,of,flower,or,shape,which,it,doth,latch,
Of,his,quick,objects,hath,the,mind,no,part,
Nor,his,own,vision,holds,what,it,doth,catch,

To,make,of,monsters,and,things,indigest,
Such,cherubins,as,your,sweet,self,resemble,
Creating,every,bad,a,perfect,best,
As,fast,as,objects,to,his,beams,assemble,

But,reckoning,time,whose,millioned,accidents,
Creep,in,'twixt,vows,and,change,decrees,of,kings,
Tan,sacred,beauty,blunt,the,sharp'st,intents,
Divert,strong,minds,to,the,course,of,alt'ring,things,

O,no,it,is,an,ever-fixed,mark,
That,looks,on,tempests,and,is,never,shaken,
It,is,the,star,to,every,wand'ring,bark,
Whose,worth,'s,unknown,although,his,height,be,taken,

That,I,have,frequent,been,with,unknown,minds,
And,given,to,time,your,own,dear-purchased,right,
That,I,have,hoisted,sail,to,all,the,winds,
Which,should,transport,me,farthest,from,your,sight,

Even,so,being,full,of,your,ne'er-cloying,sweetness,
To,bitter,sauces,did,I,frame,my,feeding,
And,sick,of,welfare,found,a,kind,of,meetness,
To,be,diseased,ere,that,there,was,true,needing,

What,wretched,errors,hath,my,heart,committed,
Whilst,it,hath,thought,it,self,so,blessed,never,
How,have,mine,eyes,out,of,their,spheres,been,fitted,
In,the,distraction,of,this,madding,fever,

For,if,you,were,by,my,unkindness,shaken,
As,I,by,yours,y'have,passed,a,hell,of,time,
And,I,a,tyrant,have,no,leisure,taken,
To,weigh,how,once,I,suffered,in,your,crime,

For,why,should,others,false,adulterate,eyes,
Give,salutation,to,my,sportive,blood,
Or,on,my,frailties,why,are,frailer,spies,
Which,in,their,wills,count,bad,what,I,think,good,

Or,at,the,least,so,long,as,brain,and,heart,
Have,faculty,by,nature,to,subsist,
Till,each,to,razed,oblivion,yield,his,part,
Of,thee,thy,record,never,can,be,missed,

Our,dates,are,brief,and,therefore,we,admire,
What,thou,dost,foist,upon,us,that,is,old,
And,rather,make,them,born,to,our,desire,
Than,think,that,we,before,have,heard,them,told,

No,it,was,builded,far,from,accident,
It,suffers,not,in,smiling,pomp,nor,falls,
Under,the,blow,of,thralled,discontent,
Whereto,th,inviting,time,our,fashion,calls,

Have,I,not,seen,dwellers,on,form,and,favour,
Lose,all,and,more,by,paying,too,much,rent,
For,compound,sweet,forgoing,simple,savour,
Pitiful,thrivers,in,their,gazing,spent,

If,Nature,sovereign,mistress,over,wrack,
As,thou,goest,onwards,still,will,pluck,thee,back,
She,keeps,thee,to,this,purpose,that,her,skill,
May,time,disgrace,and,wretched,minutes,kill,

For,since,each,hand,hath,put,on,nature,'s,power,
Fairing,the,foul,with,art,'s,false,borrowed,face,
Sweet,beauty,hath,no,name,no,holy,bower,
But,is,profaned,if,not,lives,in,disgrace,

Do,I,envy,those,jacks,that,nimble,leap,
To,kiss,the,tender,inward,of,thy,hand,
Whilst,my,poor,lips,which,should,that,harvest,reap,
At,the,wood,'s,boldness,by,thee,blushing,stand,

Enjoyed,no,sooner,but,despised,straight,
Past,reason,hunted,and,no,sooner,had,
Past,reason,hated,as,a,swallowed,bait,
On,purpose,laid,to,make,the,taker,mad,

I,have,seen,roses,damasked,red,and,white,
But,no,such,roses,see,I,in,her,cheeks,
And,in,some,perfumes,is,there,more,delight,
Than,in,the,breath,that,from,my,mistress,reeks,

Yet,in,good,faith,some,say,that,thee,behold,
Thy,face,hath,not,the,power,to,make,love,groan,
To,say,they,err,I,dare,not,be,so,bold,
Although,I,swear,it,to,my,self,alone,

And,truly,not,the,morning,sun,of,heaven,
Better,becomes,the,grey,cheeks,of,the,east,
Nor,that,full,star,that,ushers,in,the,even,
Doth,half,that,glory,to,the,sober,west,

Me,from,my,self,thy,cruel,eye,hath,taken,
And,my,next,self,thou,harder,hast,engrossed,
Of,him,my,self,and,thee,I,am,forsaken,
A,torment,thrice,three-fold,thus,to,be,crossed,

But,thou,wilt,not,nor,he,will,not,be,free,
For,thou,art,covetous,and,he,is,kind,
He,learned,but,surety-like,to,write,for,me,
Under,that,bond,that,him,as,fist,doth,bind,

Wilt,thou,whose,will,is,large,and,spacious,
Not,once,vouchsafe,to,hide,my,will,in,thine,
Shall,will,in,others,seem,right,gracious,
And,in,my,will,no,fair,acceptance,shine,

'Will,will,fulfil,the,treasure,of,thy,love,,,
Ay,fill,it,full,with,wills,and,my,will,one,
In,things,of,great,receipt,with,case,we,prove,
Among,a,number,one,is,reckoned,none,

If,eyes,corrupt,by,over-partial,looks,
Be,anchored,in,the,bay,where,all,men,ride,
Why,of,eyes,falsehood,hast,thou,forged,hooks,
Whereto,the,judgment,of,my,heart,is,tied,

Thus,vainly,thinking,that,she,thinks,me,young,
Although,she,knows,my,days,are,past,the,best,
Simply,I,credit,her,false-speaking,tongue,
On,both,sides,thus,is,simple,truth,suppressed,

Tell,me,thou,lov'st,elsewhere,but,in,my,sight,
Dear,heart,forbear,to,glance,thine,eye,aside,
What,need'st,thou,wound,with,cunning,when,thy,might,
Is,more,than,my,o'erpressed,defence,can,bide,

Though,not,to,love,yet,love,to,tell,me,so,
As,testy,sick,men,when,their,deaths,be,near,
No,news,but,health,from,their,physicians,know,

Nor,are,mine,cars,with,thy,tongue,'s,tune,delighted,
Nor,tender,feeling,to,base,touches,prone,
Nor,taste,nor,smell,desire,to,be,invited,
To,any,sensual,feast,with,thee,alone,

Or,if,it,do,not,from,those,lips,of,thine,
That,have,profaned,their,scarlet,ornaments,
And,sealed,false,bonds,of,love,as,oft,as,mine,
Robbed,others,beds,revenues,of,their,rents,

Whilst,her,neglected,child,holds,her,in,chase,
Cries,to,catch,her,whose,busy,care,is,bent,
To,follow,that,which,flies,before,her,face,
Not,prizing,her,poor,infant,'s,discontent,

To,win,me,soon,to,hell,my,female,evil,
Tempteth,my,better,angel,from,my,side,
And,would,corrupt,my,saint,to,be,a,devil,
Wooing,his,purity,with,her,foul,pride,

Straight,in,her,heart,did,mercy,come,
Chiding,that,tongue,that,ever,sweet,
Was,used,in,giving,gentle,doom,
And,taught,it,thus,anew,to,greet,

Why,so,large,cost,having,so,short,a,lease,
Dost,thou,upon,thy,fading,mansion,spend,
Shall,worms,inheritors,of,this,excess,
Eat,up,thy,charge,is,this,thy,body,'s,end,

My,reason,the,physician,to,my,love,
Angry,that,his,prescriptions,are,not,kept,
Hath,left,me,and,I,desperate,now,approve,
Desire,is,death,which,physic,did,except,

If,that,be,fair,whereon,my,false,eyes,dote,
What,means,the,world,to,say,it,is,not,so,
If,it,be,not,then,love,doth,well,denote,
Love,'s,eye,is,not,so,true,as,all,men,'s,no,

Who,hateth,thee,that,I,do,call,my,friend,
On,whom,frown'st,thou,that,I,do,fawn,upon,
Nay,if,thou,lour'st,on,me,do,I,not,spend,

Whence,hast,thou,this,becoming,of,things,ill,
That,in,the,very,refuse,of,thy,deeds,
There,is,such,strength,and,warrantise,of,skill,
That,in,my,mind,thy,worst,all,best,exceeds,

For,thou,betraying,me,I,do,betray,
My,nobler,part,to,my,gross,body,'s,treason,
My,soul,doth,tell,my,body,that,he,may,
Triumph,in,love,flesh,stays,no,farther,reason,

But,why,of,two,oaths,breach,do,I,accuse,thee,
When,I,break,twenty,I,am,perjured,most,
For,all,my,vows,are,oaths,but,to,misuse,thee,
And,all,my,honest,faith,in,thee,is,lost,

Which,borrowed,from,this,holy,fire,of,Love,
A,dateless,lively,heat,still,to,endure,
And,grew,a,seeting,bath,which,yet,men,prove,
Against,strange,maladies,a,sovereign,cure,

And,happy,lines,on,which,with,starry,light,
Those,lamping,eyes,will,deign,sometimes,to,look,
And,read,the,sorrows,of,my,dying,sprite,
Written,with,tears,in,heart,'s,close-bleeding,book,

Break,forth,at,length,out,of,the,inner,part,
In,which,thou,lurkest,like,to,viper,'s,brood,
And,seek,some,succour,both,to,ease,my,smart,
And,also,to,sustain,thy,self,with,food,

That,being,now,with,her,huge,brightness,dazed,
Base,things,I,can,no,more,endure,to,view,
But,looking,still,on,her,I,stand,amazed,
At,wondrous,sight,of,so,celestial,hew,

And,calling,forth,out,of,sad,Winter,'s,night,
Fresh,love,that,long,hath,slept,in,cheerless,bower,
Wills,him,awake,and,soon,about,him,dight,
His,wanton,wings,and,darts,of,deadly,power,

For,in,those,lofty,looks,is,close,implied,
Scorn,of,base,things,and,sdeigne,of,foul,dishonor,
Threatening,rash,eyes,which,gaze,on,her,so,wide,
That,loosely,they,ne,dare,to,look,upon,her,

The,durefull,Oak,whose,sap,is,not,yet,dried,
Is,long,ere,it,conceive,the,kindling,fire,
But,when,it,once,doth,burn,it,doth,divide,
Great,heat,and,makes,his,flames,to,heaven,aspire,

For,when,ye,mildly,look,with,lovely,hew,
Then,is,my,soul,with,life,and,love,inspired,
But,when,ye,lour,or,look,on,me,askew,
Then,do,I,die,as,one,with,lightning,fired,

Through,your,bright,beams,doth,not,the,blinded,guest,
Shoot,out,his,darts,to,base,affections,wound,
But,Angels,come,to,lead,frail,minds,to,rest,
In,chaste,desires,on,heavenly,beauty,bound,

Not,to,the,sun,for,they,do,shine,by,night,
Nor,to,the,moon,for,they,are,changed,never,
Nor,to,the,stars,for,they,have,purer,sight,
Nor,to,the,fire,for,they,consume,not,ever,

See,how,the,Tyraness,doth,joy,to,see,
The,huge,massacres,which,her,eyes,do,make,
And,humbled,hearts,brings,captives,unto,thee,
That,thou,of,them,mayst,mighty,vengeance,take,

Nor,will,be,moved,with,reason,or,with,ruth,
To,grant,small,respite,to,my,restless,toil,
But,greedily,her,fell,intent,persueth,
Of,my,poor,life,to,make,unpityed,spoil,

So,as,I,then,disarmed,did,remain,
A,wicked,ambush,which,lay,hidden,long,
In,the,close,court,of,her,guileful,eyen,
Thence,breaking,forth,did,thick,about,me,throng,

Mild,humbless,mixed,with,awful,majesty,
For,looking,on,the,earth,whence,she,was,born,
Her,mind,remembreth,her,mortality,
What,so,is,fairest,shall,to,earth,return,

'Gainst,such,strong,castles,needeth,greater,might,
Than,those,small,forts,which,ye,were,wont,belay,
Such,haughty,minds,enur,'d,to,hardy,fight,
Disdain,to,yield,unto,the,first,assay,

For,lo,my,love,doth,in,her,self,contain,
All,this,world,'s,riches,that,may,far,be,found,
If,saphires,lo,her,eyes,be,saphires,plain,
If,rubies,lo,her,lips,be,rubies,sound,

I,mote,perceive,how,in,her,glancing,sight,
Legions,of,loves,with,little,wings,did,fly,
Darting,their,deadly,arrows,fiery,bright,
At,every,rash,beholder,passing,by,

For,though,he,colours,could,devise,at,will,
And,eke,his,learned,hand,at,pleasure,guide,
Least,trembling,it,his,workmanship,should,spill,
Yet,many,wondrous,things,there,are,beside,

Yet,can,not,I,with,many,a,dropping,tear,
And,long,entreaty,soften,her,hard,heart,
That,she,will,once,vouchsafe,my,plaint,to,hear,
Or,look,with,pity,on,my,painful,smart,

With,noise,whereof,the,choir,of,birds,resounded,
Their,anthems,sweet,devised,of,love,'s,praise,
That,all,the,woods,their,echoes,back,rebounded,
As,if,they,knew,the,meaning,of,their,lays,

And,yet,the,lion,that,is,lord,of,power,
And,reighneth,over,every,beast,in,field,
In,his,most,pride,disdaineth,to,devour,
The,silly,lamb,that,to,his,might,doth,yield,

For,with,mild,pleasance,which,doth,pride,displace,
She,to,her,love,doth,lookers,eyes,allure,
And,with,stern,countenance,back,again,doth,chase,
Their,looser,looks,that,stir,up,lusts,impure,

Her,temple,fair,is,built,within,my,mind,
In,which,her,glorious,image,placed,is,
On,which,my,thoughts,do,day,and,night,attend,
Like,sacred,priests,that,never,think,amiss,

Such,subtle,craft,my,Damsel,doth,conceive,
Th'importune,suit,of,my,desire,to,shun,
For,all,that,I,in,many,days,do,weave,
In,one,short,hour,I,find,by,her,undone,

But,when,I,feel,the,bitter,baleful,smart,
Which,her,fair,eyes,unwares,do,work,in,me,
That,death,out,of,their,shiny,beams,do,dart,
I,think,that,I,a,new,Pandora,see,

Yet,better,were,at,once,to,let,me,die,
And,show,the,last,ensample,of,your,pride,
Than,to,torment,me,thus,with,cruelty,
To,prove,your,power,which,I,too,well,have,tried,

Sweet,is,the,Cypress,but,his,rind,is,tough,
Sweet,is,the,nut,but,bitter,is,his,pill,
Sweet,is,the,broom-flower,but,yet,sour,enough,
And,sweet,is,Moly,but,his,root,is,ill,

That,goodly,idol,now,so,gay,beseen,
Shall,doff,her,flesh,'s,borrowed,fair,attire,
And,be,forgot,as,it,had,never,been,
That,many,now,much,worship,and,admire,

The,power,thereof,which,of,in,me,I,find,
Let,in,likewise,your,gentle,breast,inspire,
With,sweet,infusion,and,put,you,in,mind,
Of,that,proud,maid,whom,now,those,leave,attire,

The,bay,quoth,she,is,of,the,victors,borne,
Yielded,them,by,the,vanquished,as,their,meeds,
And,they,therewith,do,poets,heads,adorn,
To,sing,the,glory,of,their,famous,deeds,

Or,how,comes,it,that,my,exceeding,heat,
Is,not,delayed,by,her,heart,frozen,cold,
But,that,I,burn,much,more,in,boiling,sweat,
And,feel,my,flames,augmented,manifold,

Sith,to,all,other,beasts,of,bloody,race,
A,dreadful,countenance,she,given,hath,
That,with,their,terror,all,the,rest,may,chase,
And,warn,to,shun,the,danger,of,their,wrath,

Yet,can,not,all,these,flames,in,which,I,fry,
Her,heart,more,hard,than,iron,soft,a,whit,
Ne,all,the,plaints,and,prayers,with,which,I,
Do,beat,on,th'anvil,of,her,stubborn,wit,

But,lodwick,this,of,grace,to,me,aread,
Do,ye,not,think,the'accomplishment,of,it,
Sufficient,work,for,one,man,'s,simple,head,
All,were,it,as,the,rest,but,rudely,writ,

So,I,whose,star,that,wont,with,her,bright,ray,
Me,to,direct,with,clouds,is,overcast,
Do,wander,now,in,darkness,and,dismay,
Through,hidden,perils,round,about,me,plast,

For,lacking,it,they,can,not,life,sustain,
And,having,it,they,gaze,on,it,the,more,
In,their,amazement,like,Narcissus,vain,
Whose,eyes,him,starv,'d,so,plenty,makes,me,poor,

Is,there,no,means,for,me,to,purchase,peace,
Or,make,agreement,with,her,thrilling,eyes,
But,that,their,cruelty,doth,still,increase,
And,daily,more,augment,my,miseries,

Is,it,that,men,'s,frail,eyes,which,gaze,too,bold,
She,may,entangle,in,that,golden,snare,
And,being,caught,may,craftily,enfold,
Their,weaker,hearts,which,are,not,well,aware,

But,my,rude,music,which,was,wont,to,please,
Some,dainty,ears,can,not,with,any,skill,
The,dreadful,tempest,of,her,wrath,appease,
Nor,move,the,dolphin,from,her,stubborn,will,

Sweet,is,thy,virtue,as,thy,self,sweet,art,
For,when,on,me,thou,shinedst,late,in,sadness,
A,melting,pleasance,ran,through,every,part,
And,me,revived,with,heart,robbing,gladness,

Likest,it,seemeth,in,my,simple,wit,
Unto,the,fair,sunshine,in,summer,'s,day,
That,when,a,dreadful,storm,away,is,flit,
Through,the,broad,world,doth,spread,his,goodly,ray,

But,if,her,nature,and,her,will,be,so,
that,she,will,plague,the,man,that,loves,her,most,
And,take,delight,t'increase,a,wretch,'s,woe,
Then,all,her,nature,'s,goodly,gifts,are,lost,

Ne,do,I,wish,for,wishing,were,but,vain,
To,be,acquit,from,my,continual,smart,
But,joy,her,thrall,for,ever,to,remain,
And,yield,for,pledge,my,poor,captived,heart,

What,tyranny,is,this,both,my,heart,to,thrall,
And,eke,my,tongue,with,proud,restraint,to,tie,
That,neither,I,may,speak,nor,think,at,all,
But,like,a,stupid,stock,in,silence,die,

But,this,continual,cruel,civil,war,
The,which,myself,against,myself,do,make,
Whilest,my,weak,powers,of,passions,warried,are,
No,skill,can,stint,nor,reason,can,aslake,

Within,my,heart,though,hardly,it,can,shew,
Thing,so,divine,to,view,of,earthly,eye,
The,fair,Idea,of,your,celestial,hue,
And,every,part,remains,immortally,

Whom,then,shall,I,or,heaven,or,her,obey,
The,heavens,know,best,what,is,the,best,form,
But,as,she,will,whose,will,my,life,doth,sway,
My,lower,heaven,so,it,perforce,must,be,

So,she,with,flattering,smiles,weak,hearts,doth,guide,
Unto,her,love,and,tempt,to,their,decay,
Whom,being,caught,she,kills,with,cruel,pride,
And,feeds,at,pleasure,on,the,wretched,pray,

Well,worthy,thou,to,have,found,better,hire,
Then,so,bad,end,for,heretics,ordained,
Yet,heresy,nor,treason,didst,conspire,
But,plead,thy,master,'s,cause,unjustly,pained,

But,if,it,be,your,pleasure,and,proud,will,
To,show,the,power,of,your,imperious,eyes,
Then,not,on,him,that,never,thought,you,ill,
But,bend,your,force,against,your,enemies,

Vain,man,quoth,I,that,hast,but,little,priefe,
In,deep,discovery,of,the,mind,'s,disease,
Is,not,the,heart,of,all,the,body,chief,
And,rules,the,members,as,itself,doth,please,

Why,then,do,I,untrained,in,lovers,trade,
Her,hardness,blame,which,I,should,more,commend,
Sith,never,aught,was,excellect,assayed,
Which,was,not,hard,t'achieve,and,bring,to,end,

So,do,I,now,myself,a,prisoner,yield,
To,sorrow,and,to,solitary,pain,
From,presence,of,my,dearest,dear,exiled,
Longwhile,alone,in,languor,to,remain,

Right,so,my,cruel,fair,with,me,doth,play,
For,with,the,goodly,semblance,of,her,hue,
She,doth,allure,me,to,mine,own,decay,
And,then,no,mercy,will,unto,me,shew,

Sometimes,I,joy,when,glad,occasion,fits,
And,mask,in,mirth,like,to,a,comedy,
Soon,after,when,my,joy,to,sorrow,flits,
I,wail,and,make,my,woes,a,tragedy,

Not,earth,for,her,high,thoughts,more,heavenly,are,
Not,water,for,her,love,doth,burn,like,fire,
Not,air,for,she,is,not,so,light,or,rare,
Not,fire,for,she,doth,freeze,with,faint,desire,

Fair,be,ye,sure,but,proud,and,pityless,
As,is,a,storm,that,all,things,doth,prostrate,
Finding,a,tree,alone,all,comfortless,
Beats,on,it,strongly,it,to,ruinate,

So,weak,my,powers,so,sore,my,wounds,appear,
That,wonder,is,how,I,should,live,a,jot,
Seeing,my,heart,through,launched,everywhere,
With,thousand,arrows,which,your,eyes,have,shot,

But,like,a,steady,ship,doth,strongly,part,
The,raging,waves,and,keeps,her,course,aright,
Ne,aught,for,tempest,doth,from,it,depart,
Ne,aught,for,fairer,weather,false,delight,

So,since,the,winged,God,his,planet,clear,
Began,in,me,to,move,one,year,is,spent,
The,which,doth,longer,unto,me,appear,
Than,all,those,forty,which,my,life,outwent,

For,being,as,she,is,divinely,wrought,
And,of,the,brood,of,angels,heavenly,born,
And,with,the,crew,of,blessed,saints,upbrought,
Each,of,which,did,her,with,their,gifts,adorn,

So,let,us,which,this,change,of,weather,view,
Change,each,our,minds,and,former,lives,amend,
The,old,year,'s,sins,forepast,let,us,eschew,
And,fly,the,faults,with,which,we,did,offend,

I,do,at,length,descry,the,happy,shore,
In,which,I,hope,ere,long,for,to,arrive,
Fair,soil,it,seems,from,far,and,fraught,with,store,
Of,all,that,dear,and,dainty,is,alive,

Her,lips,did,smell,like,unto,Gillyflowers,
Her,ruddy,cheeks,like,unto,Roses,red,
Her,snowy,brows,like,budded,Bellamores,
Her,lovely,eyes,like,Pinks,but,newly,spread,

Sweet,be,the,bands,the,which,true,love,doth,tie,
Without,constraint,or,dread,of,any,ill,
The,gentle,bird,feels,no,captivity,
Within,her,cage,but,sings,and,feeds,her,fill,

Yet,whose,high,worths,surpassing,paragon,
Could,not,on,earth,have,found,one,fit,for,mate,
Ne,but,in,heaven,matchable,to,none,
Why,did,ye,stoop,unto,so,lowly,state,

So,after,long,pursuit,and,vain,assay,
When,I,all,weary,had,the,chase,forsook,
The,gentle,deer,returned,the,self-same,way,
Thinking,to,quench,her,thirst,at,the,next,brook,

This,joyous,day,dear,Lord,with,joy,begin,
And,grant,that,we,for,whom,thou,didst,die,
Being,with,thy,dear,blood,clean,washed,from,sin,
May,live,for,ever,in,felicity,

What,trophy,then,shall,I,most,fit,devise,
In,which,I,may,record,the,memory,
Of,my,love,'s,conquest,peerless,beauty,'s,prize,
Adorn,'d,with,honour,love,and,chastity,

Go,to,my,love,where,she,is,careless,laid,
Yet,in,her,winter,'s,bower,not,well,awake,
Tell,her,the,joyous,time,will,not,be,staid,
Unless,she,do,him,by,the,forelock,take,

Right,so,youself,were,caught,in,cunning,snare,
Of,a,dear,foe,and,thralled,to,his,love,
In,whose,straight,bands,ye,now,captived,are,
So,firmly,that,ye,never,may,remove,

Where,when,that,sovereign,beauty,it,doth,spy,
Resembling,heaven,'s,glory,in,her,light,
Drawn,with,sweet,pleasure,'s,bait,it,back,doth,fly,
And,unto,heaven,forgets,her,former,flight,

Like,as,a,bird,that,in,one,'s,hand,doth,spy,
Desired,food,to,it,doth,make,his,flight,
Even,so,my,heart,that,wont,on,your,fair,eye,
To,feed,his,fill,flys,back,unto,your,sight,

The,first,my,being,to,me,gave,by,kind,
From,mother,'s,womb,deriv,'d,by,due,descent,
The,second,is,my,sovereign,Queen,most,kind,
That,honour,and,large,riches,to,me,lent,

Vain,man,said,she,that,doest,in,vain,assay,
A,mortal,thing,so,to,immortalize,
For,I,myself,shall,like,to,this,decay,
And,eek,my,name,be,wiped,out,likewise,

How,was,I,ravished,with,your,lovely,sight,
And,my,frail,thoughts,too,rashly,led,astray,
Whiles,diving,deep,through,amorous,insight,
On,the,sweet,spoil,of,beauty,they,did,prey,

'Mongst,which,there,in,a,silver,dish,did,lie,
Two,golden,apples,of,unvalued,price,
Far,passing,those,which,Hercules,came,by,
Or,those,which,Atalanta,did,entice,

I,seek,the,fields,with,her,late,footing,signed,
I,seek,her,bower,with,her,late,presence,decked,
Yet,nor,in,field,nor,bower,I,her,can,find,
Yet,field,and,bower,are,full,of,her,aspect,

For,all,the,rest,how,ever,fair,it,be,
Shall,turn,to,naught,and,loose,that,glorious,hue,
But,only,that,is,permanent,and,free,
From,frail,corruption,that,doth,flesh,ensue,

Then,as,a,steed,refreshed,after,toil,
Out,of,my,prison,I,will,break,anew,
And,stoutly,will,that,second,work,assoyle,
With,strong,endeavor,and,attention,due,

Fair,when,her,breast,like,a,rich-laden,bark,
With,precious,merchandise,she,forth,doth,lay,
Fair,when,that,cloud,of,pride,which,oft,doth,dark,
Her,goodly,light,with,smiles,she,drives,away,

For,had,the,equal,heavens,so,much,you,graced,
In,this,as,in,the,rest,ye,mote,invent,
Soom,heavenly,wit,whose,verse,could,have,enchased,
Your,glorious,name,in,golden,monument,

For,lacking,it,they,can,not,life,sustain,
And,seeing,it,they,gaze,on,it,the,more,
In,their,amazement,like,Narcissus,vain,
Whose,eyes,him,starv,'d,so,plenty,makes,me,poor,

And,modest,thoughts,breathed,from,well,tempered,sprites,
Go,visit,her,in,her,chaste,bower,of,rest,
Accompanied,with,angelic,delights,
There,fill,yourself,with,those,most,joyous,sights,

But,they,that,skill,not,of,so,heavenly,matter,
All,that,they,know,not,envy,or,admire,
Rather,than,envy,let,them,wonder,at,her,
But,not,to,deem,of,her,desert,aspire,

Let,all,the,plagues,and,horrid,pains,of,hell,
Upon,thee,fall,for,thine,accursed,hire,
That,with,false-forged,lies,which,thou,didst,tell,
In,my,true,love,did,stir,up,coals,of,ire,

For,when,as,day,the,heaven,doth,adorn,
I,wish,that,night,the,noyous,day,would,end,
And,when,as,night,hath,us,of,light,forlorn,
I,wish,that,day,would,shortly,reascend,

Ne,ought,I,see,though,in,the,clearest,day,
When,others,gaze,upon,their,shadows,vain,
But,th'only,image,of,that,heavenly,ray,
Whereof,some,glance,doth,in,mine,eye,remain,
