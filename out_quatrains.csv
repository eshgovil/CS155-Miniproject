From,fairest,creatures,we,desire,increase,
That,thereby,beauty,'s,rose,might,never,die,
But,as,the,riper,should,by,time,decease,
His,tender,heir,might,bear,his,memory,

Thou,that,art,now,the,world,'s,fresh,ornament,
And,only,herald,to,the,gaudy,spring,
Within,thine,own,bud,buriest,thy,content,
And,tender,churl,mak'st,waste,in,niggarding,

When,forty,winters,shall,besiege,thy,brow,
And,dig,deep,trenches,in,thy,beauty,'s,field,
Thy,youth,'s,proud,livery,so,gazed,on,now,
Will,be,a,tattered,weed,of,small,worth,held,

How,much,more,praise,deserved,thy,beauty,'s,use,
If,thou,couldst,answer,'This,fair,child,of,mine,
Shall,sum,my,count,and,make,my,old,excuse,
Proving,his,beauty,by,succession,thine,

Look,in,thy,glass,and,tell,the,face,thou,viewest,
Now,is,the,time,that,face,should,form,another,
Whose,fresh,repair,if,now,thou,not,renewest,
Thou,dost,beguile,the,world,unbless,some,mother,

Thou,art,thy,mother,'s,glass,and,she,in,thee,
Calls,back,the,lovely,April,of,her,prime,
So,thou,through,windows,of,thine,age,shalt,see,
Despite,of,wrinkles,this,thy,golden,time,

Unthrifty,loveliness,why,dost,thou,spend,
Upon,thy,self,thy,beauty,'s,legacy,
Nature,'s,bequest,gives,nothing,but,doth,lend,
And,being,frank,she,lends,to,those,are,free,

For,having,traffic,with,thy,self,alone,
Thou,of,thy,self,thy,sweet,self,dost,deceive,
Then,how,when,nature,calls,thee,to,be,gone,
What,acceptable,audit,canst,thou,leave,

Those,hours,that,with,gentle,work,did,frame,
The,lovely,gaze,where,every,eye,doth,dwell,
Will,play,the,tyrants,to,the,very,same,
And,that,unfair,which,fairly,doth,excel,

Then,were,not,summer,'s,distillation,left,
A,liquid,prisoner,pent,in,walls,of,glass,
Beauty,'s,effect,with,beauty,were,bereft,
Nor,it,nor,no,remembrance,what,it,was,

Then,let,not,winter,'s,ragged,hand,deface,
In,thee,thy,summer,ere,thou,be,distilled,
Make,sweet,some,vial,treasure,thou,some,place,
With,beauty,'s,treasure,ere,it,be,self-killed,

Ten,times,thy,self,were,happier,than,thou,art,
If,ten,of,thine,ten,times,refigured,thee,
Then,what,could,death,do,if,thou,shouldst,depart,
Leaving,thee,living,in,posterity,

Lo,in,the,orient,when,the,gracious,light,
Lifts,up,his,burning,head,each,under,eye,
Doth,homage,to,his,new-appearing,sight,
Serving,with,looks,his,sacred,majesty,

But,when,from,highmost,pitch,with,weary,car,
Like,feeble,age,he,reeleth,from,the,day,
The,eyes,fore,duteous,now,converted,are,
From,his,low,tract,and,look,another,way,

Music,to,hear,why,hear'st,thou,music,sadly,
Sweets,with,sweets,war,not,joy,delights,in,joy,
Why,lov'st,thou,that,which,thou,receiv'st,not,gladly,
Or,else,receiv'st,with,pleasure,thine,annoy,

Mark,how,one,string,sweet,husband,to,another,
Strikes,each,in,each,by,mutual,ordering,
Resembling,sire,and,child,and,happy,mother,
Who,all,in,one,one,pleasing,note,do,sing,

Is,it,for,fear,to,wet,a,widow,'s,eye,
That,thou,consum'st,thy,self,in,single,life,
Ah,if,thou,issueless,shalt,hap,to,die,
The,world,will,wail,thee,like,a,makeless,wife,

Look,what,an,unthrift,in,the,world,doth,spend,
Shifts,but,his,place,for,still,the,world,enjoys,it,
But,beauty,'s,waste,hath,in,the,world,an,end,
And,kept,unused,the,user,so,destroys,it,

For,shame,deny,that,thou,bear'st,love,to,any,
Who,for,thy,self,art,so,unprovident,
Grant,if,thou,wilt,thou,art,beloved,of,many,
But,that,thou,none,lov'st,is,most,evident,

O,change,thy,thought,that,I,may,change,my,mind,
Shall,hate,be,fairer,lodged,than,gentle,love,
Be,as,thy,presence,is,gracious,and,kind,
Or,to,thy,self,at,least,kind-hearted,prove,

As,fast,as,thou,shalt,wane,so,fast,thou,grow'st,
In,one,of,thine,from,that,which,thou,departest,
And,that,fresh,blood,which,youngly,thou,bestow'st,
Thou,mayst,call,thine,when,thou,from,youth,convertest,

Let,those,whom,nature,hath,not,made,for,store,
Harsh,featureless,and,rude,barrenly,perish,
Look,whom,she,best,endowed,she,gave,thee,more,
Which,bounteous,gift,thou,shouldst,in,bounty,cherish,

When,I,do,count,the,clock,that,tells,the,time,
And,see,the,brave,day,sunk,in,hideous,night,
When,I,behold,the,violet,past,prime,
And,sable,curls,all,silvered,o'er,with,white,

Then,of,thy,beauty,do,I,question,make,
That,thou,among,the,wastes,of,time,must,go,
Since,sweets,and,beauties,do,themselves,forsake,
And,die,as,fast,as,they,see,others,grow,

O,that,you,were,your,self,but,love,you,are,
No,longer,yours,than,you,your,self,here,live,
Against,this,coming,end,you,should,prepare,
And,your,sweet,semblance,to,some,other,give,

Who,lets,so,fair,a,house,fall,to,decay,
Which,husbandry,in,honour,might,uphold,
Against,the,stormy,gusts,of,winter,'s,day,
And,barren,rage,of,death,'s,eternal,cold,

Not,from,the,stars,do,I,my,judgement,pluck,
And,yet,methinks,I,have,astronomy,
But,not,to,tell,of,good,or,evil,luck,
Of,plagues,of,dearths,or,seasons,quality,

But,from,thine,eyes,my,knowledge,I,derive,
And,constant,stars,in,them,I,read,such,art,
As,truth,and,beauty,shall,together,thrive,
If,from,thy,self,to,store,thou,wouldst,convert,

When,I,consider,every,thing,that,grows,
Holds,in,perfection,but,a,little,moment,
That,this,huge,stage,presenteth,nought,but,shows,
Whereon,the,stars,in,secret,influence,comment,

Then,the,conceit,of,this,inconstant,stay,
Sets,you,most,rich,in,youth,before,my,sight,
Where,wasteful,time,debateth,with,decay,
To,change,your,day,of,youth,to,sullied,night,

But,wherefore,do,not,you,a,mightier,way,
Make,war,upon,this,bloody,tyrant,Time,
And,fortify,your,self,in,your,decay,
With,means,more,blessed,than,my,barren,rhyme,

So,should,the,lines,of,life,that,life,repair,
Which,this,Time,'s,pencil,or,my,pupil,pen,
Neither,in,inward,worth,nor,outward,fair,
Can,make,you,live,your,self,in,eyes,of,men,

Who,will,believe,my,verse,in,time,to,come,
If,it,were,filled,with,your,most,high,deserts,
Though,yet,heaven,knows,it,is,but,as,a,tomb,
Which,hides,your,life,and,shows,not,half,your,parts,

So,should,my,papers,yellowed,with,their,age,
Be,scorned,like,old,men,of,less,truth,than,tongue,
And,your,true,rights,be,termed,a,poet,'s,rage,
And,stretched,metre,of,an,antique,song,

Shall,I,compare,thee,to,a,summer,'s,day,
Thou,art,more,lovely,and,more,temperate,
Rough,winds,do,shake,the,darling,buds,of,May,
And,summer,'s,lease,hath,all,too,short,a,date,

But,thy,eternal,summer,shall,not,fade,
Nor,lose,possession,of,that,fair,thou,ow'st,
Nor,shall,death,brag,thou,wand'rest,in,his,shade,
When,in,eternal,lines,to,time,thou,grow'st,

Devouring,Time,blunt,thou,the,lion,'s,paws,
And,make,the,earth,devour,her,own,sweet,brood,
Pluck,the,keen,teeth,from,the,fierce,tiger,'s,jaws,
And,burn,the,long-lived,phoenix,in,her,blood,

O,carve,not,with,thy,hours,my,love,'s,fair,brow,
Nor,draw,no,lines,there,with,thine,antique,pen,
Him,in,thy,course,untainted,do,allow,
For,beauty,'s,pattern,to,succeeding,men,

A,woman,'s,face,with,nature,'s,own,hand,painted,
Hast,thou,the,master,mistress,of,my,passion,
A,woman,'s,gentle,heart,but,not,acquainted,
With,shifting,change,as,is,false,women,'s,fashion,

And,for,a,woman,wert,thou,first,created,
Till,nature,as,she,wrought,thee,fell,a-doting,
And,by,addition,me,of,thee,defeated,
By,adding,one,thing,to,my,purpose,nothing,

So,is,it,not,with,me,as,with,that,muse,
Stirred,by,a,painted,beauty,to,his,verse,
Who,heaven,it,self,for,ornament,doth,use,
And,every,fair,with,his,fair,doth,rehearse,

O,let,me,true,in,love,but,truly,write,
And,then,believe,me,my,love,is,as,fair,
As,any,mother,'s,child,though,not,so,bright,
As,those,gold,candles,fixed,in,heaven,'s,air,

My,glass,shall,not,persuade,me,I,am,old,
So,long,as,youth,and,thou,are,of,one,date,
But,when,in,thee,time,'s,furrows,I,behold,
Then,look,I,death,my,days,should,expiate,

O,therefore,love,be,of,thyself,so,wary,
As,I,not,for,my,self,but,for,thee,will,
Bearing,thy,heart,which,I,will,keep,so,chary,
As,tender,nurse,her,babe,from,faring,ill,

As,an,unperfect,actor,on,the,stage,
Who,with,his,fear,is,put,beside,his,part,
Or,some,fierce,thing,replete,with,too,much,rage,
Whose,strength,'s,abundance,weakens,his,own,heart,

O,let,my,looks,be,then,the,eloquence,
And,dumb,presagers,of,my,speaking,breast,
Who,plead,for,love,and,look,for,recompense,
More,than,that,tongue,that,more,hath,more,expressed,

Mine,eye,hath,played,the,painter,and,hath,stelled,
Thy,beauty,'s,form,in,table,of,my,heart,
My,body,is,the,frame,wherein,'t,is,held,
And,perspective,it,is,best,painter,'s,art,

Now,see,what,good,turns,eyes,for,eyes,have,done,
Mine,eyes,have,drawn,thy,shape,and,thine,for,me,
Are,windows,to,my,breast,where-through,the,sun,
Delights,to,peep,to,gaze,therein,on,thee,

Let,those,who,are,in,favour,with,their,stars,
Of,public,honour,and,proud,titles,boast,
Whilst,I,whom,fortune,of,such,triumph,bars,
Unlooked,for,joy,in,that,I,honour,most,

The,painful,warrior,famoused,for,fight,
After,a,thousand,victories,once,foiled,
Is,from,the,book,of,honour,razed,quite,
And,all,the,rest,forgot,for,which,he,toiled,

Lord,of,my,love,to,whom,in,vassalage,
Thy,merit,hath,my,duty,strongly,knit,
To,thee,I,send,this,written,embassage,
To,witness,duty,not,to,show,my,wit,

Till,whatsoever,star,that,guides,my,moving,
Points,on,me,graciously,with,fair,aspect,
And,puts,apparel,on,my,tattered,loving,
To,show,me,worthy,of,thy,sweet,respect,

Weary,with,toil,I,haste,me,to,my,bed,
The,dear,respose,for,limbs,with,travel,tired,
But,then,begins,a,journey,in,my,head,
To,work,my,mind,when,body,'s,work,'s,expired,

Save,that,my,soul,'s,imaginary,sight,
Presents,thy,shadow,to,my,sightless,view,
Which,like,a,jewel,hung,in,ghastly,night,
Makes,black,night,beauteous,and,her,old,face,new,

How,can,I,then,return,in,happy,plight,
That,am,debarred,the,benefit,of,rest,
When,day,'s,oppression,is,not,eased,by,night,
But,day,by,night,and,night,by,day,oppressed,

I,tell,the,day,to,please,him,thou,art,bright,
And,dost,him,grace,when,clouds,do,blot,the,heaven,
So,flatter,I,the,swart-complexioned,night,
When,sparkling,stars,twire,not,thou,gild'st,the,even,

When,in,disgrace,with,Fortune,and,men,'s,eyes,
I,all,alone,beweep,my,outcast,state,
And,trouble,deaf,heaven,with,my,bootless,cries,
And,look,upon,my,self,and,curse,my,fate,

Yet,in,these,thoughts,my,self,almost,despising,
Haply,I,think,on,thee,and,then,my,state,
Like,to,the,lark,at,break,of,day,arising,
From,sullen,earth,sings,hymns,at,heaven,'s,gate,

When,to,the,sessions,of,sweet,silent,thought,
I,summon,up,remembrance,of,things,past,
I,sigh,the,lack,of,many,a,thing,I,sought,
And,with,old,woes,new,wail,my,dear,time,'s,waste,

Then,can,I,grieve,at,grievances,foregone,
And,heavily,from,woe,to,woe,tell,o'er,
The,sad,account,of,fore-bemoaned,moan,
Which,I,new,pay,as,if,not,paid,before,

Thy,bosom,is,endeared,with,all,hearts,
Which,I,by,lacking,have,supposed,dead,
And,there,reigns,love,and,all,love,'s,loving,parts,
And,all,those,friends,which,I,thought,buried,

Thou,art,the,grave,where,buried,love,doth,live,
Hung,with,the,trophies,of,my,lovers,gone,
Who,all,their,parts,of,me,to,thee,did,give,
That,due,of,many,now,is,thine,alone,

If,thou,survive,my,well-contented,day,
When,that,churl,death,my,bones,with,dust,shall,cover,
And,shalt,by,fortune,once,more,re-survey,
These,poor,rude,lines,of,thy,deceased,lover,

O,then,vouchsafe,me,but,this,loving,thought,
'Had,my,friend,'s,Muse,grown,with,this,growing,age,
A,dearer,birth,than,this,his,love,had,brought,
To,march,in,ranks,of,better,equipage,

Full,many,a,glorious,morning,have,I,seen,
Flatter,the,mountain,tops,with,sovereign,eye,
Kissing,with,golden,face,the,meadows,green,
Gilding,pale,streams,with,heavenly,alchemy,

Even,so,my,sun,one,early,morn,did,shine,
With,all,triumphant,splendour,on,my,brow,
But,out,alack,he,was,but,one,hour,mine,
The,region,cloud,hath,masked,him,from,me,now,

Why,didst,thou,promise,such,a,beauteous,day,
And,make,me,travel,forth,without,my,cloak,
To,let,base,clouds,o'ertake,me,in,my,way,
Hiding,thy,brav'ry,in,their,rotten,smoke,

Nor,can,thy,shame,give,physic,to,my,grief,
Though,thou,repent,yet,I,have,still,the,loss,
Th,offender,'s,sorrow,lends,but,weak,relief,
To,him,that,bears,the,strong,offence,'s,cross,

No,more,be,grieved,at,that,which,thou,hast,done,
Roses,have,thorns,and,silver,fountains,mud,
Clouds,and,eclipses,stain,both,moon,and,sun,
And,loathsome,canker,lives,in,sweetest,bud,

For,to,thy,sensual,fault,I,bring,in,sense,
Thy,adverse,party,is,thy,advocate,
And,'gainst,my,self,a,lawful,plea,commence,
Such,civil,war,is,in,my,love,and,hate,

Let,me,confess,that,we,two,must,be,twain,
Although,our,undivided,loves,are,one,
So,shall,those,blots,that,do,with,me,remain,
Without,thy,help,by,me,be,borne,alone,

I,may,not,evermore,acknowledge,thee,
Lest,my,bewailed,guilt,should,do,thee,shame,
Nor,thou,with,public,kindness,honour,me,
Unless,thou,take,that,honour,from,thy,name,

As,a,decrepit,father,takes,delight,
To,see,his,active,child,do,deeds,of,youth,
So,I,made,lame,by,Fortune,'s,dearest,spite,
Take,all,my,comfort,of,thy,worth,and,truth,

So,then,I,am,not,lame,poor,nor,despised,
Whilst,that,this,shadow,doth,such,substance,give,
That,I,in,thy,abundance,am,sufficed,
And,by,a,part,of,all,thy,glory,live,

How,can,my,muse,want,subject,to,invent,
While,thou,dost,breathe,that,pour'st,into,my,verse,
Thine,own,sweet,argument,too,excellent,
For,every,vulgar,paper,to,rehearse,

Be,thou,the,tenth,Muse,ten,times,more,in,worth,
Than,those,old,nine,which,rhymers,invocate,
And,he,that,calls,on,thee,let,him,bring,forth,
Eternal,numbers,to,outlive,long,date,

O,how,thy,worth,with,manners,may,I,sing,
When,thou,art,all,the,better,part,of,me,
What,can,mine,own,praise,to,mine,own,self,bring,
And,what,is't,but,mine,own,when,I,praise,thee,

O,absence,what,a,torment,wouldst,thou,prove,
Were,it,not,thy,sour,leisure,gave,sweet,leave,
To,entertain,the,time,with,thoughts,of,love,
Which,time,and,thoughts,so,sweetly,doth,deceive,

Take,all,my,loves,my,love,yea,take,them,all,
What,hast,thou,then,more,than,thou,hadst,before,
No,love,my,love,that,thou,mayst,true,love,call,
All,mine,was,thine,before,thou,hadst,this,more,

I,do,forgive,thy,robbery,gentle,thief,
Although,thou,steal,thee,all,my,poverty,
And,yet,love,knows,it,is,a,greater,grief,
To,bear,greater,wrong,than,hate,'s,known,injury,

Those,pretty,wrongs,that,liberty,commits,
When,I,am,sometime,absent,from,thy,heart,
Thy,beauty,and,thy,years,full,well,befits,
For,still,temptation,follows,where,thou,art,

Ay,me,but,yet,thou,mightst,my,seat,forbear,
And,chide,thy,beauty,and,thy,straying,youth,
Who,lead,thee,in,their,riot,even,there,
Where,thou,art,forced,to,break,a,twofold,truth,

That,thou,hast,her,it,is,not,all,my,grief,
And,yet,it,may,be,said,I,loved,her,dearly,
That,she,hath,thee,is,of,my,wailing,chief,
A,loss,in,love,that,touches,me,more,nearly,

If,I,lose,thee,my,loss,is,my,love,'s,gain,
And,losing,her,my,friend,hath,found,that,loss,
Both,find,each,other,and,I,lose,both,twain,
And,both,for,my,sake,lay,on,me,this,cross,

When,most,I,wink,then,do,mine,eyes,best,see,
For,all,the,day,they,view,things,unrespected,
But,when,I,sleep,in,dreams,they,look,on,thee,
And,darkly,bright,are,bright,in,dark,directed,

How,would,I,say,mine,eyes,be,blessed,made,
By,looking,on,thee,in,the,living,day,
When,in,dead,night,thy,fair,imperfect,shade,
Through,heavy,sleep,on,sightless,eyes,doth,stay,

If,the,dull,substance,of,my,flesh,were,thought,
Injurious,distance,should,not,stop,my,way,
For,then,despite,of,space,I,would,be,brought,
From,limits,far,remote,where,thou,dost,stay,

But,ah,thought,kills,me,that,I,am,not,thought,
To,leap,large,lengths,of,miles,when,thou,art,gone,
But,that,so,much,of,earth,and,water,wrought,
I,must,attend,time,'s,leisure,with,my,moan,

The,other,two,slight,air,and,purging,fire,
Are,both,with,thee,wherever,I,abide,
The,first,my,thought,the,other,my,desire,
These,present-absent,with,swift,motion,slide,

Until,life,'s,composition,be,recured,
By,those,swift,messengers,returned,from,thee,
Who,even,but,now,come,back,again,assured,
Of,thy,fair,health,recounting,it,to,me,

Mine,eye,and,heart,are,at,a,mortal,war,
How,to,divide,the,conquest,of,thy,sight,
Mine,eye,my,heart,thy,picture,'s,sight,would,bar,
My,heart,mine,eye,the,freedom,of,that,right,

To,side,this,title,is,impanelled,
A,quest,of,thoughts,all,tenants,to,the,heart,
And,by,their,verdict,is,determined,
The,clear,eye,'s,moiety,and,the,dear,heart,'s,part,

Betwixt,mine,eye,and,heart,a,league,is,took,
And,each,doth,good,turns,now,unto,the,other,
When,that,mine,eye,is,famished,for,a,look,
Or,heart,in,love,with,sighs,himself,doth,smother,

So,either,by,thy,picture,or,my,love,
Thy,self,away,art,present,still,with,me,
For,thou,not,farther,than,my,thoughts,canst,move,
And,I,am,still,with,them,and,they,with,thee,

How,careful,was,I,when,I,took,my,way,
Each,trifle,under,truest,bars,to,thrust,
That,to,my,use,it,might,unused,stay,
From,hands,of,falsehood,in,sure,wards,of,trust,

Thee,have,I,not,locked,up,in,any,chest,
Save,where,thou,art,not,though,I,feel,thou,art,
Within,the,gentle,closure,of,my,breast,
From,whence,at,pleasure,thou,mayst,come,and,part,

Against,that,time,if,ever,that,time,come,
When,I,shall,see,thee,frown,on,my,defects,
When,as,thy,love,hath,cast,his,utmost,sum,
Called,to,that,audit,by,advised,respects,

Against,that,time,do,I,ensconce,me,here,
Within,the,knowledge,of,mine,own,desert,
And,this,my,hand,against,my,self,uprear,
To,guard,the,lawful,reasons,on,thy,part,

How,heavy,do,I,journey,on,the,way,
When,what,I,seek,my,weary,travel,'s,end,
Doth,teach,that,case,and,that,repose,to,say,
'Thus,far,the,miles,are,measured,from,thy,friend,',

The,bloody,spur,can,not,provoke,him,on,
That,sometimes,anger,thrusts,into,his,hide,
Which,heavily,he,answers,with,a,groan,
More,sharp,to,me,than,spurring,to,his,side,

Thus,can,my,love,excuse,the,slow,offence,
Of,my,dull,bearer,when,from,thee,I,speed,
From,where,thou,art,why,should,I,haste,me,thence,
Till,I,return,of,posting,is,no,need,

Then,can,no,horse,with,my,desire,keep,pace,
Therefore,desire,of,perfect'st,love,being,made,
Shall,neigh,no,dull,flesh,in,his,fiery,race,
But,love,for,love,thus,shall,excuse,my,jade,

So,am,I,as,the,rich,whose,blessed,key,
Can,bring,him,to,his,sweet,up-locked,treasure,
The,which,he,will,not,every,hour,survey,
For,blunting,the,fine,point,of,seldom,pleasure,

So,is,the,time,that,keeps,you,as,my,chest,
Or,as,the,wardrobe,which,the,robe,doth,hide,
To,make,some,special,instant,special-blest,
By,new,unfolding,his,imprisoned,pride,

What,is,your,substance,whereof,are,you,made,
That,millions,of,strange,shadows,on,you,tend,
Since,every,one,hath,every,one,one,shade,
And,you,but,one,can,every,shadow,lend,

Speak,of,the,spring,and,foison,of,the,year,
The,one,doth,shadow,of,your,beauty,show,
The,other,as,your,bounty,doth,appear,
And,you,in,every,blessed,shape,we,know,

O,how,much,more,doth,beauty,beauteous,seem,
By,that,sweet,ornament,which,truth,doth,give,
The,rose,looks,fair,but,fairer,we,it,deem,
For,that,sweet,odour,which,doth,in,it,live,

But,for,their,virtue,only,is,their,show,
They,live,unwooed,and,unrespected,fade,
Die,to,themselves,Sweet,roses,do,not,so,
Of,their,sweet,deaths,are,sweetest,odours,made,

Not,marble,nor,the,gilded,monuments,
Of,princes,shall,outlive,this,powerful,rhyme,
But,you,shall,shine,more,bright,in,these,contents,
Than,unswept,stone,besmeared,with,sluttish,time,

'Gainst,death,and,all-oblivious,enmity,
Shall,you,pace,forth,your,praise,shall,still,find,room,
Even,in,the,eyes,of,all,posterity,
That,wear,this,world,out,to,the,ending,doom,

Sweet,love,renew,thy,force,be,it,not,said,
Thy,edge,should,blunter,be,than,appetite,
Which,but,to-day,by,feeding,is,allayed,
To-morrow,sharpened,in,his,former,might,

Let,this,sad,interim,like,the,ocean,be,
Which,parts,the,shore,where,two,contracted,new,
Come,daily,to,the,banks,that,when,they,see,
Return,of,love,more,blest,may,be,the,view,

Being,your,slave,what,should,I,do,but,tend,
Upon,the,hours,and,times,of,your,desire,
I,have,no,precious,time,at,all,to,spend,
Nor,services,to,do,till,you,require,

Nor,dare,I,question,with,my,jealous,thought,
Where,you,may,be,or,your,affairs,suppose,
But,like,a,sad,slave,stay,and,think,of,nought,
Save,where,you,are,how,happy,you,make,those,

That,god,forbid,that,made,me,first,your,slave,
I,should,in,thought,control,your,times,of,pleasure,
Or,at,your,hand,th,account,of,hours,to,crave,
Being,your,vassal,bound,to,stay,your,leisure,

Be,where,you,list,your,charter,is,so,strong,
That,you,your,self,may,privilage,your,time,
To,what,you,will,to,you,it,doth,belong,
Your,self,to,pardon,of,self-doing,crime,

If,there,be,nothing,new,but,that,which,is,
Hath,been,before,how,are,our,brains,beguiled,
Which,labouring,for,invention,bear,amis,
The,second,burthen,of,a,former,child,

That,I,might,see,what,the,old,world,could,say,
To,this,composed,wonder,of,your,frame,
Whether,we,are,mended,or,whether,better,they,
Or,whether,revolution,be,the,same,

Like,as,the,waves,make,towards,the,pebbled,shore,
So,do,our,minutes,hasten,to,their,end,
Each,changing,place,with,that,which,goes,before,
In,sequent,toil,all,forwards,do,contend,

Time,doth,transfix,the,flourish,set,on,youth,
And,delves,the,parallels,in,beauty,'s,brow,
Feeds,on,the,rarities,of,nature,'s,truth,
And,nothing,stands,but,for,his,scythe,to,mow,

Is,it,thy,will,thy,image,should,keep,open,
My,heavy,eyelids,to,the,weary,night,
Dost,thou,desire,my,slumbers,should,be,broken,
While,shadows,like,to,thee,do,mock,my,sight,

O,no,thy,love,though,much,is,not,so,great,
It,is,my,love,that,keeps,mine,eye,awake,
Mine,own,true,love,that,doth,my,rest,defeat,
To,play,the,watchman,ever,for,thy,sake,

Sin,of,self-love,possesseth,all,mine,eye,
And,all,my,soul,and,all,my,every,part,
And,for,this,sin,there,is,no,remedy,
It,is,so,grounded,inward,in,my,heart,

But,when,my,glass,shows,me,my,self,indeed,
beated,and,chopt,with,tanned,antiquity,
Mine,own,self-love,quite,contrary,I,read,
Self,so,self-loving,were,iniquity,

Against,my,love,shall,be,as,I,am,now,
With,Time,'s,injurious,hand,crushed,and,o'erworn,
When,hours,have,drained,his,blood,and,filled,his,brow,
With,lines,and,wrinkles,when,his,youthful,morn,

For,such,a,time,do,I,now,fortify,
Against,confounding,age,'s,cruel,knife,
That,he,shall,never,cut,from,memory,
My,sweet,love,'s,beauty,though,my,lover,'s,life,

When,I,have,seen,by,Time,'s,fell,hand,defaced,
The,rich-proud,cost,of,outworn,buried,age,
When,sometime,lofty,towers,I,see,down-rased,
And,brass,eternal,slave,to,mortal,rage,

When,I,have,seen,such,interchange,of,State,
Or,state,it,self,confounded,to,decay,
Ruin,hath,taught,me,thus,to,ruminate,
That,Time,will,come,and,take,my,love,away,

Since,brass,nor,stone,nor,earth,nor,boundless,sea,
But,sad,mortality,o'ersways,their,power,
How,with,this,rage,shall,beauty,hold,a,plea,
Whose,action,is,no,stronger,than,a,flower,

O,fearful,meditation,where,alack,
Shall,Time,'s,best,jewel,from,Time,'s,chest,lie,hid,
Or,what,strong,hand,can,hold,his,swift,foot,back,
Or,who,his,spoil,of,beauty,can,forbid,

Tired,with,all,these,for,restful,death,I,cry,
As,to,behold,desert,a,beggar,born,
And,needy,nothing,trimmed,in,jollity,
And,purest,faith,unhappily,forsworn,

And,art,made,tongue-tied,by,authority,
And,folly,doctor-like,controlling,skill,
And,simple,truth,miscalled,simplicity,
And,captive,good,attending,captain,ill,

Ah,wherefore,with,infection,should,he,live,
And,with,his,presence,grace,impiety,
That,sin,by,him,advantage,should,achieve,
And,lace,it,self,with,his,society,

Why,should,he,live,now,nature,bankrupt,is,
Beggared,of,blood,to,blush,through,lively,veins,
For,she,hath,no,exchequer,now,but,his,
And,proud,of,many,lives,upon,his,gains,

Thus,is,his,cheek,the,map,of,days,outworn,
When,beauty,lived,and,died,as,flowers,do,now,
Before,these,bastard,signs,of,fair,were,born,
Or,durst,inhabit,on,a,living,brow,

In,him,those,holy,antique,hours,are,seen,
Without,all,ornament,it,self,and,true,
Making,no,summer,of,another,'s,green,
Robbing,no,old,to,dress,his,beauty,new,

Those,parts,of,thee,that,the,world,'s,eye,doth,view,
Want,nothing,that,the,thought,of,hearts,can,mend,
All,tongues,the,voice,of,souls,give,thee,that,due,
Uttering,bare,truth,even,so,as,foes,commend,

They,look,into,the,beauty,of,thy,mind,
And,that,in,guess,they,measure,by,thy,deeds,
Then,churls,their,thoughts,although,their,eyes,were,kind,
To,thy,fair,flower,add,the,rank,smell,of,weeds,

That,thou,art,blamed,shall,not,be,thy,defect,
For,slander,'s,mark,was,ever,yet,the,fair,
The,ornament,of,beauty,is,suspect,
A,crow,that,flies,in,heaven,'s,sweetest,air,

Thou,hast,passed,by,the,ambush,of,young,days,
Either,not,assailed,or,victor,being,charged,
Yet,this,thy,praise,can,not,be,so,thy,praise,
To,tie,up,envy,evermore,enlarged,

No,longer,mourn,for,me,when,I,am,dead,
Than,you,shall,hear,the,surly,sullen,bell,
Give,warning,to,the,world,that,I,am,fled,
From,this,vile,world,with,vilest,worms,to,dwell,

O,if,I,say,you,look,upon,this,verse,
When,I,perhaps,compounded,am,with,clay,
Do,not,so,much,as,my,poor,name,rehearse,
But,let,your,love,even,with,my,life,decay,

O,lest,the,world,should,task,you,to,recite,
What,merit,lived,in,me,that,you,should,love,
After,my,death,dear,love,forget,me,quite,
For,you,in,me,can,nothing,worthy,prove,

O,lest,your,true,love,may,seem,false,in,this,
That,you,for,love,speak,well,of,me,untrue,
My,name,be,buried,where,my,body,is,
And,live,no,more,to,shame,nor,me,nor,you,

That,time,of,year,thou,mayst,in,me,behold,
When,yellow,leaves,or,none,or,few,do,hang,
Upon,those,boughs,which,shake,against,the,cold,
Bare,ruined,choirs,where,late,the,sweet,birds,sang,

In,me,thou,seest,the,glowing,of,such,fire,
That,on,the,ashes,of,his,youth,doth,lie,
As,the,death-bed,whereon,it,must,expire,
Consumed,with,that,which,it,was,nourished,by,

But,be,contented,when,that,fell,arrest,
Without,all,bail,shall,carry,me,away,
My,life,hath,in,this,line,some,interest,
Which,for,memorial,still,with,thee,shall,stay,

So,then,thou,hast,but,lost,the,dregs,of,life,
The,prey,of,worms,my,body,being,dead,
The,coward,conquest,of,a,wretch,'s,knife,
Too,base,of,thee,to,be,remembered,

So,are,you,to,my,thoughts,as,food,to,life,
Or,as,sweet-seasoned,showers,are,to,the,ground,
And,for,the,peace,of,you,I,hold,such,strife,
As,'twixt,a,miser,and,his,wealth,is,found,

Sometime,all,full,with,feasting,on,your,sight,
And,by,and,by,clean,starved,for,a,look,
Possessing,or,pursuing,no,delight,
Save,what,is,had,or,must,from,you,be,took,

Why,is,my,verse,so,barren,of,new,pride,
So,far,from,variation,or,quick,change,
Why,with,the,time,do,I,not,glance,aside,
To,new-found,methods,and,to,compounds,strange,

O,know,sweet,love,I,always,write,of,you,
And,you,and,love,are,still,my,argument,
So,all,my,best,is,dressing,old,words,new,
Spending,again,what,is,already,spent,

Thy,glass,will,show,thee,how,thy,beauties,wear,
Thy,dial,how,thy,precious,minutes,waste,
These,vacant,leaves,thy,mind,'s,imprint,will,bear,
And,of,this,book,this,learning,mayst,thou,taste,

Look,what,thy,memory,can,not,contain,
Commit,to,these,waste,blanks,and,thou,shalt,find,
Those,children,nursed,delivered,from,thy,brain,
To,take,a,new,acquaintance,of,thy,mind,

So,oft,have,I,invoked,thee,for,my,muse,
And,found,such,fair,assistance,in,my,verse,
As,every,alien,pen,hath,got,my,use,
And,under,thee,their,poesy,disperse,

Yet,be,most,proud,of,that,which,I,compile,
Whose,influence,is,thine,and,born,of,thee,
In,others,works,thou,dost,but,mend,the,style,
And,arts,with,thy,sweet,graces,graced,be,

Whilst,I,alone,did,call,upon,thy,aid,
My,verse,alone,had,all,thy,gentle,grace,
But,now,my,gracious,numbers,are,decayed,
And,my,sick,muse,doth,give,an,other,place,

He,lends,thee,virtue,and,he,stole,that,word,
From,thy,behaviour,beauty,doth,he,give,
And,found,it,in,thy,cheek,he,can,afford,
No,praise,to,thee,but,what,in,thee,doth,live,

O,how,I,faint,when,I,of,you,do,write,
Knowing,a,better,spirit,doth,use,your,name,
And,in,the,praise,thereof,spends,all,his,might,
To,make,me,tongue-tied,speaking,of,your,fame,

Your,shallowest,help,will,hold,me,up,afloat,
Whilst,he,upon,your,soundless,deep,doth,ride,
Or,being,wrecked,I,am,a,worthless,boat,
He,of,tall,building,and,of,goodly,pride,

Or,I,shall,live,your,epitaph,to,make,
Or,you,survive,when,I,in,earth,am,rotten,
From,hence,your,memory,death,can,not,take,
Although,in,me,each,part,will,be,forgotten,

Your,monument,shall,be,my,gentle,verse,
Which,eyes,not,yet,created,shall,o'er-read,
And,tongues,to,be,your,being,shall,rehearse,
When,all,the,breathers,of,this,world,are,dead,

I,grant,thou,wert,not,married,to,my,muse,
And,therefore,mayst,without,attaint,o'erlook,
The,dedicated,words,which,writers,use,
Of,their,fair,subject,blessing,every,book,

And,do,so,love,yet,when,they,have,devised,
What,strained,touches,rhetoric,can,lend,
Thou,truly,fair,wert,truly,sympathized,
In,true,plain,words,by,thy,true-telling,friend,

I,never,saw,that,you,did,painting,need,
And,therefore,to,your,fair,no,painting,set,
I,found,or,thought,I,found,you,did,exceed,
That,barren,tender,of,a,poet,'s,debt,

This,silence,for,my,sin,you,did,impute,
Which,shall,be,most,my,glory,being,dumb,
For,I,impair,not,beauty,being,mute,
When,others,would,give,life,and,bring,a,tomb,

Who,is,it,that,says,most,which,can,say,more,
Than,this,rich,praise,that,you,alone,are,you,
In,whose,confine,immured,is,the,store,
Which,should,example,where,your,equal,grew,

Let,him,but,copy,what,in,you,is,writ,
Not,making,worse,what,nature,made,so,clear,
And,such,a,counterpart,shall,fame,his,wit,
Making,his,style,admired,every,where,

My,tongue-tied,muse,in,manners,holds,her,still,
While,comments,of,your,praise,richly,compiled,
Reserve,their,character,with,golden,quill,
And,precious,phrase,by,all,the,Muses,filed,

Hearing,you,praised,I,say,'t,is,so,'t,is,true,
And,to,the,most,of,praise,add,something,more,
But,that,is,in,my,thought,whose,love,to,you,
Though,words,come,hindmost,holds,his,rank,before,

Was,it,the,proud,full,sail,of,his,great,verse,
Bound,for,the,prize,of,all,too,precious,you,
That,did,my,ripe,thoughts,in,my,brain,inhearse,
Making,their,tomb,the,womb,wherein,they,grew,

He,nor,that,affable,familiar,ghost,
Which,nightly,gulls,him,with,intelligence,
As,victors,of,my,silence,can,not,boast,
I,was,not,sick,of,any,fear,from,thence,

Farewell,thou,art,too,dear,for,my,possessing,
And,like,enough,thou,know'st,thy,estimate,
The,charter,of,thy,worth,gives,thee,releasing,
My,bonds,in,thee,are,all,determinate,

Thy,self,thou,gav'st,thy,own,worth,then,not,knowing,
Or,me,to,whom,thou,gav'st,it,else,mistaking,
So,thy,great,gift,upon,misprision,growing,
Comes,home,again,on,better,judgement,making,

When,thou,shalt,be,disposed,to,set,me,light,
And,place,my,merit,in,the,eye,of,scorn,
Upon,thy,side,against,my,self,I,'ll,fight,
And,prove,thee,virtuous,though,thou,art,forsworn,

And,I,by,this,will,be,a,gainer,too,
For,bending,all,my,loving,thoughts,on,thee,
The,injuries,that,to,my,self,I,do,
Doing,thee,vantage,double-vantage,me,

Say,that,thou,didst,forsake,me,for,some,fault,
And,I,will,comment,upon,that,offence,
Speak,of,my,lameness,and,I,straight,will,halt,
Against,thy,reasons,making,no,defence,

Be,absent,from,thy,walks,and,in,my,tongue,
Thy,sweet,beloved,name,no,more,shall,dwell,
Lest,I,too,much,profane,should,do,it,wronk,
And,haply,of,our,old,acquaintance,tell,

Then,hate,me,when,thou,wilt,if,ever,now,
Now,while,the,world,is,bent,my,deeds,to,cross,
join,with,the,spite,of,fortune,make,me,bow,
And,do,not,drop,in,for,an,after-loss,

If,thou,wilt,leave,me,do,not,leave,me,last,
When,other,petty,griefs,have,done,their,spite,
But,in,the,onset,come,so,shall,I,taste,
At,first,the,very,worst,of,fortune,'s,might,

Some,glory,in,their,birth,some,in,their,skill,
Some,in,their,wealth,some,in,their,body,'s,force,
Some,in,their,garments,though,new-fangled,ill,
Some,in,their,hawks,and,hounds,some,in,their,horse,

Thy,love,is,better,than,high,birth,to,me,
Richer,than,wealth,prouder,than,garments,costs,
Of,more,delight,than,hawks,and,horses,be,
And,having,thee,of,all,men,'s,pride,I,boast,

But,do,thy,worst,to,steal,thy,self,away,
For,term,of,life,thou,art,assured,mine,
And,life,no,longer,than,thy,love,will,stay,
For,it,depends,upon,that,love,of,thine,

Thou,canst,not,vex,me,with,inconstant,mind,
Since,that,my,life,on,thy,revolt,doth,lie,
O,what,a,happy,title,do,I,find,
Happy,to,have,thy,love,happy,to,die,

So,shall,I,live,supposing,thou,art,true,
Like,a,deceived,husband,so,love,'s,face,
May,still,seem,love,to,me,though,altered,new,
Thy,looks,with,me,thy,heart,in,other,place,

But,heaven,in,thy,creation,did,decree,
That,in,thy,face,sweet,love,should,ever,dwell,
Whate'er,thy,thoughts,or,thy,heart,'s,workings,be,
Thy,looks,should,nothing,thence,but,sweetness,tell,

They,that,have,power,to,hurt,and,will,do,none,
That,do,not,do,the,thing,they,most,do,show,
Who,moving,others,are,themselves,as,stone,
Unmoved,cold,and,to,temptation,slow,

The,summer,'s,flower,is,to,the,summer,sweet,
Though,to,it,self,it,only,live,and,die,
But,if,that,flower,with,base,infection,meet,
The,basest,weed,outbraves,his,dignity,

How,sweet,and,lovely,dost,thou,make,the,shame,
Which,like,a,canker,in,the,fragrant,rose,
Doth,spot,the,beauty,of,thy,budding,name,
O,in,what,sweets,dost,thou,thy,sins,enclose,

O,what,a,mansion,have,those,vices,got,
Which,for,their,habitation,chose,out,thee,
Where,beauty,'s,veil,doth,cover,every,blot,
And,all,things,turns,to,fair,that,eyes,can,see,

Some,say,thy,fault,is,youth,some,wantonness,
Some,say,thy,grace,is,youth,and,gentle,sport,
Both,grace,and,faults,are,loved,of,more,and,less,
Thou,mak'st,faults,graces,that,to,thee,resort,

How,many,lambs,might,the,stern,wolf,betray,
If,like,a,lamb,he,could,his,looks,translate,
How,many,gazers,mightst,thou,lead,away,
if,thou,wouldst,use,the,strength,of,all,thy,state,

How,like,a,winter,hath,my,absence,been,
From,thee,the,pleasure,of,the,fleeting,year,
What,freezings,have,I,felt,what,dark,days,seen,
What,old,December,'s,bareness,everywhere,

Yet,this,abundant,issue,seemed,to,me,
But,hope,of,orphans,and,unfathered,fruit,
For,summer,and,his,pleasures,wait,on,thee,
And,thou,away,the,very,birds,are,mute,

From,you,have,I,been,absent,in,the,spring,
When,proud-pied,April,dressed,in,all,his,trim,
Hath,put,a,spirit,of,youth,in,every,thing,
That,heavy,Saturn,laughed,and,leaped,with,him,

Nor,did,I,wonder,at,the,lily,'s,white,
Nor,praise,the,deep,vermilion,in,the,rose,
They,were,but,sweet,but,figures,of,delight,
Drawn,after,you,you,pattern,of,all,those,

The,forward,violet,thus,did,I,chide,
Sweet,thief,whence,didst,thou,steal,thy,sweet,that,smells,
If,not,from,my,love,'s,breath,The,purple,pride,
Which,on,thy,soft,check,for,complexion,dwells,

One,blushing,shame,another,white,despair,
A,third,nor,red,nor,white,had,stol'n,of,both,
And,to,his,robbery,had,annexed,thy,breath,
But,for,his,theft,in,pride,of,all,his,growth,

Where,art,thou,Muse,that,thou,forget'st,so,long,
To,speak,of,that,which,gives,thee,all,thy,might,
Spend'st,thou,thy,fury,on,some,worthless,song,
Darkening,thy,power,to,lend,base,subjects,light,

Rise,resty,Muse,my,love,'s,sweet,face,survey,
If,time,have,any,wrinkle,graven,there,
If,any,be,a,satire,to,decay,
And,make,time,'s,spoils,despised,everywhere,

O,truant,Muse,what,shall,be,thy,amends,
For,thy,neglect,of,truth,in,beauty,dyed,
Both,truth,and,beauty,on,my,love,depends,
So,dost,thou,too,and,therein,dignified,

Because,he,needs,no,praise,wilt,thou,be,dumb,
Excuse,not,silence,so,for't,lies,in,thee,
To,make,him,much,outlive,a,gilded,tomb,
And,to,be,praised,of,ages,yet,to,be,

My,love,is,strengthened,though,more,weak,in,seeming,
I,love,not,less,though,less,the,show,appear,
That,love,is,merchandized,whose,rich,esteeming,
The,owner,'s,tongue,doth,publish,every,where,

Not,that,the,summer,is,less,pleasant,now,
Than,when,her,mournful,hymns,did,hush,the,night,
But,that,wild,music,burthens,every,bough,
And,sweets,grown,common,lose,their,dear,delight,

Alack,what,poverty,my,muse,brings,forth,
That,having,such,a,scope,to,show,her,pride,
The,argument,all,bare,is,of,more,worth,
Than,when,it,hath,my,added,praise,beside,

Were,it,not,sinful,then,striving,to,mend,
To,mar,the,subject,that,before,was,well,
For,to,no,other,pass,my,verses,tend,
Than,of,your,graces,and,your,gifts,to,tell,

To,me,fair,friend,you,never,can,be,old,
For,as,you,were,when,first,your,eye,I,eyed,
Such,seems,your,beauty,still,three,winters,cold,
Have,from,the,forests,shook,three,summers,pride,

Ah,yet,doth,beauty,like,a,dial,hand,
Steal,from,his,figure,and,no,pace,perceived,
So,your,sweet,hue,which,methinks,still,doth,stand,
Hath,motion,and,mine,eye,may,be,deceived,

Let,not,my,love,be,called,idolatry,
Nor,my,beloved,as,an,idol,show,
Since,all,alike,my,songs,and,praises,be,
To,one,of,one,still,such,and,ever,so,

Fair,kind,and,true,is,all,my,argument,
Fair,kind,and,true,varying,to,other,words,
And,in,this,change,is,my,invention,spent,
Three,themes,in,one,which,wondrous,scope,affords,

When,in,the,chronicle,of,wasted,time,
I,see,descriptions,of,the,fairest,wights,
And,beauty,making,beautiful,old,rhyme,
In,praise,of,ladies,dead,and,lovely,knights,

So,all,their,praises,are,but,prophecies,
Of,this,our,time,all,you,prefiguring,
And,for,they,looked,but,with,divining,eyes,
They,had,not,skill,enough,your,worth,to,sing,

Not,mine,own,fears,nor,the,prophetic,soul,
Of,the,wide,world,dreaming,on,things,to,come,
Can,yet,the,lease,of,my,true,love,control,
Supposed,as,forfeit,to,a,confined,doom,

Now,with,the,drops,of,this,most,balmy,time,
My,love,looks,fresh,and,death,to,me,subscribes,
Since,spite,of,him,I,'ll,live,in,this,poor,rhyme,
While,he,insults,o'er,dull,and,speechless,tribes,

What,'s,in,the,brain,that,ink,may,character,
Which,hath,not,figured,to,thee,my,true,spirit,
What,'s,new,to,speak,what,now,to,register,
That,may,express,my,love,or,thy,dear,merit,

So,that,eternal,love,in,love,'s,fresh,case,
Weighs,not,the,dust,and,injury,of,age,
Nor,gives,to,necessary,wrinkles,place,
But,makes,antiquity,for,aye,his,page,

O,never,say,that,I,was,false,of,heart,
Though,absence,seemed,my,flame,to,qualify,
As,easy,might,I,from,my,self,depart,
As,from,my,soul,which,in,thy,breast,doth,lie,

Never,believe,though,in,my,nature,reigned,
All,frailties,that,besiege,all,kinds,of,blood,
That,it,could,so,preposterously,be,stained,
To,leave,for,nothing,all,thy,sum,of,good,

Alas,'t,is,true,I,have,gone,here,and,there,
And,made,my,self,a,motley,to,the,view,
Gored,mine,own,thoughts,sold,cheap,what,is,most,dear,
Made,old,offences,of,affections,new,

Now,all,is,done,have,what,shall,have,no,end,
Mine,appetite,I,never,more,will,grind,
On,newer,proof,to,try,an,older,friend,
A,god,in,love,to,whom,I,am,confined,

O,for,my,sake,do,you,with,Fortune,chide,
The,guilty,goddess,of,my,harmful,deeds,
That,did,not,better,for,my,life,provide,
Than,public,means,which,public,manners,breeds,

Whilst,like,a,willing,patient,I,will,drink,
Potions,of,eisel,'gainst,my,strong,infection,
No,bitterness,that,I,will,bitter,think,
Nor,double,penance,to,correct,correction,

Your,love,and,pity,doth,th,impression,fill,
Which,vulgar,scandal,stamped,upon,my,brow,
For,what,care,I,who,calls,me,well,or,ill,
So,you,o'er-green,my,bad,my,good,allow,

In,so,profound,abysm,I,throw,all,care,
Of,others,voices,that,my,adder,'s,sense,
To,critic,and,to,flatterer,stopped,are,
Mark,how,with,my,neglect,I,do,dispense,

Since,I,left,you,mine,eye,is,in,my,mind,
And,that,which,governs,me,to,go,about,
Doth,part,his,function,and,is,partly,blind,
Seems,seeing,but,effectually,is,out,

For,if,it,see,the,rud'st,or,gentlest,sight,
The,most,sweet,favour,or,deformed'st,creature,
The,mountain,or,the,sea,the,day,or,night,
The,crow,or,dove,it,shapes,them,to,your,feature,

Or,whether,doth,my,mind,being,crowned,with,you,
Drink,up,the,monarch,'s,plague,this,flattery,
Or,whether,shall,I,say,mine,eye,saith,true,
And,that,your,love,taught,it,this,alchemy,

O,'t,is,the,first,'t,is,flattery,in,my,seeing,
And,my,great,mind,most,kingly,drinks,it,up,
Mine,eye,well,knows,what,with,his,gust,is,'greeing,
And,to,his,palate,doth,prepare,the,cup,

Those,lines,that,I,before,have,writ,do,lie,
Even,those,that,said,I,could,not,love,you,dearer,
Yet,then,my,judgment,knew,no,reason,why,
My,most,full,flame,should,afterwards,burn,clearer,

Alas,why,fearing,of,time,'s,tyranny,
Might,I,not,then,say,'Now,I,love,you,best,',
When,I,was,certain,o'er,incertainty,
Crowning,the,present,doubting,of,the,rest,

Let,me,not,to,the,marriage,of,true,minds,
Admit,impediments,love,is,not,love,
Which,alters,when,it,alteration,finds,
Or,bends,with,the,remover,to,remove,

Love,'s,not,Time,'s,fool,though,rosy,lips,and,cheeks,
Within,his,bending,sickle,'s,compass,come,
Love,alters,not,with,his,brief,hours,and,weeks,
But,bears,it,out,even,to,the,edge,of,doom,

Accuse,me,thus,that,I,have,scanted,all,
Wherein,I,should,your,great,deserts,repay,
Forgot,upon,your,dearest,love,to,call,
Whereto,all,bonds,do,tie,me,day,by,day,

Book,both,my,wilfulness,and,errors,down,
And,on,just,proof,surmise,accumulate,
Bring,me,within,the,level,of,your,frown,
But,shoot,not,at,me,in,your,wakened,hate,

Like,as,to,make,our,appetite,more,keen,
With,eager,compounds,we,our,palate,urge,
As,to,prevent,our,maladies,unseen,
We,sicken,to,shun,sickness,when,we,purge,

Thus,policy,in,love,t,anticipate,
The,ills,that,were,not,grew,to,faults,assured,
And,brought,to,medicine,a,healthful,state,
Which,rank,of,goodness,would,by,ill,be,cured,

What,potions,have,I,drunk,of,Siren,tears,
Distilled,from,limbecks,foul,as,hell,within,
Applying,fears,to,hopes,and,hopes,to,fears,
Still,losing,when,I,saw,my,self,to,win,

O,benefit,of,ill,now,I,find,true,
That,better,is,by,evil,still,made,better,
And,ruined,love,when,it,is,built,anew,
Grows,fairer,than,at,first,more,strong,far,greater,

That,you,were,once,unkind,befriends,me,now,
And,for,that,sorrow,which,I,then,did,feel,
Needs,must,I,under,my,transgression,bow,
Unless,my,nerves,were,brass,or,hammered,steel,

O,that,our,night,of,woe,might,have,remembered,
My,deepest,sense,how,hard,true,sorrow,hits,
And,soon,to,you,as,you,to,me,then,tendered,
The,humble,salve,which,wounded,bosoms,fits,

'T,is,better,to,be,vile,than,vile,esteemed,
When,not,to,be,receives,reproach,of,being,
And,the,just,pleasure,lost,which,is,so,deemed,
Not,by,our,feeling,but,by,others,seeing,

No,I,am,that,I,am,and,they,that,level,
At,my,abuses,reckon,up,their,own,
I,may,be,straight,though,they,themselves,be,bevel,
By,their,rank,thoughts,my,deeds,must,not,be,shown,

Thy,gift,thy,tables,are,within,my,brain,
Full,charactered,with,lasting,memory,
Which,shall,above,that,idle,rank,remain,
Beyond,all,date,even,to,eternity,

That,poor,retention,could,not,so,much,hold,
Nor,need,I,tallies,thy,dear,love,to,score,
Therefore,to,give,them,from,me,was,I,bold,
To,trust,those,tables,that,receive,thee,more,

No,Time,thou,shalt,not,boast,that,I,do,change,
Thy,pyramids,built,up,with,newer,might,
To,me,are,nothing,novel,nothing,strange,
They,are,but,dressings,Of,a,former,sight,

Thy,registers,and,thee,I,both,defy,
Not,wond'ring,at,the,present,nor,the,past,
For,thy,records,and,what,we,see,doth,lie,
Made,more,or,less,by,thy,continual,haste,

If,my,dear,love,were,but,the,child,of,state,
It,might,for,Fortune,'s,bastard,be,unfathered,
As,subject,to,time,'s,love,or,to,time,'s,hate,
Weeds,among,weeds,or,flowers,with,flowers,gathered,

It,fears,not,policy,that,heretic,
Which,works,on,leases,of,short-numbered,hours,
But,all,alone,stands,hugely,politic,
That,it,nor,grows,with,heat,nor,drowns,with,showers,

Were't,aught,to,me,I,bore,the,canopy,
With,my,extern,the,outward,honouring,
Or,laid,great,bases,for,eternity,
Which,proves,more,short,than,waste,or,ruining,

No,let,me,be,obsequious,in,thy,heart,
And,take,thou,my,oblation,poor,but,free,
Which,is,not,mixed,with,seconds,knows,no,art,
But,mutual,render,only,me,for,thee,

O,thou,my,lovely,boy,who,in,thy,power,
Dost,hold,Time,'s,fickle,glass,his,fickle,hour,
Who,hast,by,waning,grown,and,therein,show'st,
Thy,lovers,withering,as,thy,sweet,self,grow'st,

Yet,fear,her,O,thou,minion,of,her,pleasure,
She,may,detain,but,not,still,keep,her,treasure,
Her,audit,though,delayed,answered,must,be,
And,her,quietus,is,to,render,thee,

In,the,old,age,black,was,not,counted,fair,
Or,if,it,were,it,bore,not,beauty,'s,name,
But,now,is,black,beauty,'s,successive,heir,
And,beauty,slandered,with,a,bastard,shame,

Therefore,my,mistress,eyes,are,raven,black,
Her,eyes,so,suited,and,they,mourners,seem,
At,such,who,not,born,fair,no,beauty,lack,
Slandering,creation,with,a,false,esteem,

How,oft,when,thou,my,music,music,play'st,
Upon,that,blessed,wood,whose,motion,sounds,
With,thy,sweet,fingers,when,thou,gently,sway'st,
The,wiry,concord,that,mine,ear,confounds,

To,be,so,tickled,they,would,change,their,state,
And,situation,with,those,dancing,chips,
O'er,whom,thy,fingers,walk,with,gentle,gait,
Making,dead,wood,more,blest,than,living,lips,

Th,expense,of,spirit,in,a,waste,of,shame,
Is,lust,in,action,and,till,action,lust,
Is,perjured,murd'rous,bloody,full,of,blame,
Savage,extreme,rude,cruel,not,to,trust,

Mad,in,pursuit,and,in,possession,so,
Had,having,and,in,quest,to,have,extreme,
A,bliss,in,proof,and,proved,a,very,woe,
Before,a,joy,proposed,behind,a,dream,

My,mistress,eyes,are,nothing,like,the,sun,
Coral,is,far,more,red,than,her,lips,red,
If,snow,be,white,why,then,her,breasts,are,dun,
If,hairs,be,wires,black,wires,grow,on,her,head,

I,love,to,hear,her,speak,yet,well,I,know,
That,music,hath,a,far,more,pleasing,sound,
I,grant,I,never,saw,a,goddess,go,
My,mistress,when,she,walks,treads,on,the,ground,

Thou,art,as,tyrannous,so,as,thou,art,
As,those,whose,beauties,proudly,make,them,cruel,
For,well,thou,know'st,to,my,dear,doting,heart,
Thou,art,the,fairest,and,most,precious,jewel,

And,to,be,sure,that,is,not,false,I,swear,
A,thousand,groans,but,thinking,on,thy,face,
One,on,another,'s,neck,do,witness,bear,
Thy,black,is,fairest,in,my,judgment,'s,place,

Thine,eyes,I,love,and,they,as,pitying,me,
Knowing,thy,heart,torment,me,with,disdain,
Have,put,on,black,and,loving,mourners,be,
Looking,with,pretty,ruth,upon,my,pain,

As,those,two,mourning,eyes,become,thy,face,
O,let,it,then,as,well,beseem,thy,heart,
To,mourn,for,me,since,mourning,doth,thee,grace,
And,suit,thy,pity,like,in,every,part,

Beshrew,that,heart,that,makes,my,heart,to,groan,
For,that,deep,wound,it,gives,my,friend,and,me,
Is't,not,enough,to,torture,me,alone,
But,slave,to,slavery,my,sweet'st,friend,must,be,

Prison,my,heart,in,thy,steel,bosom,'s,ward,
But,then,my,friend,'s,heart,let,my,poor,heart,bail,
Whoe'er,keeps,me,let,my,heart,be,his,guard,
Thou,canst,not,then,use,rigour,in,my,gaol,

So,now,I,have,confessed,that,he,is,thine,
And,I,my,self,am,mortgaged,to,thy,will,
My,self,I,'ll,forfeit,so,that,other,mine,
Thou,wilt,restore,to,be,my,comfort,still,

The,statute,of,thy,beauty,thou,wilt,take,
Thou,usurer,that,put'st,forth,all,to,use,
And,sue,a,friend,came,debtor,for,my,sake,
So,him,I,lose,through,my,unkind,abuse,

Whoever,hath,her,wish,thou,hast,thy,will,
And,'Will,to,boot,and,'Will,in,over-plus,
More,than,enough,am,I,that,vex,thee,still,
To,thy,sweet,will,making,addition,thus,

The,sea,all,water,yet,receives,rain,still,
And,in,abundance,addeth,to,his,store,
So,thou,being,rich,in,will,add,to,thy,will,
One,will,of,mine,to,make,thy,large,will,more,

If,thy,soul,check,thee,that,I,come,so,near,
Swear,to,thy,blind,soul,that,I,was,thy,'Will,,,
And,will,thy,soul,knows,is,admitted,there,
Thus,far,for,love,my,love-suit,sweet,fulfil,

Then,in,the,number,let,me,pass,untold,
Though,in,thy,store,'s,account,I,one,must,be,
For,nothing,hold,me,so,it,please,thee,hold,
That,nothing,me,a,something,sweet,to,thee,

Thou,blind,fool,Love,what,dost,thou,to,mine,eyes,
That,they,behold,and,see,not,what,they,see,
They,know,what,beauty,is,see,where,it,lies,
Yet,what,the,best,is,take,the,worst,to,be,

Why,should,my,heart,think,that,a,several,plot,
Which,my,heart,knows,the,wide,world,'s,common,place,
Or,mine,eyes,seeing,this,say,this,is,not,
To,put,fair,truth,upon,so,foul,a,face,

When,my,love,swears,that,she,is,made,of,truth,
I,do,believe,her,though,I,know,she,lies,
That,she,might,think,me,some,untutored,youth,
Unlearned,in,the,world,'s,false,subtleties,

But,wherefore,says,she,not,she,is,unjust,
And,wherefore,say,not,I,that,I,am,old,
O,love,'s,best,habit,is,in,seeming,trust,
And,age,in,love,loves,not,to,have,years,told,

O,call,not,me,to,justify,the,wrong,
That,thy,unkindness,lays,upon,my,heart,
Wound,me,not,with,thine,eye,but,with,thy,tongue,
Use,power,with,power,and,slay,me,not,by,art,

Let,me,excuse,thee,ah,my,love,well,knows,
Her,pretty,looks,have,been,mine,enemies,
And,therefore,from,my,face,she,turns,my,foes,
That,they,elsewhere,might,dart,their,injuries,

Be,wise,as,thou,art,cruel,do,not,press,
My,tongue-tied,patience,with,too,much,disdain,
Lest,sorrow,lend,me,words,and,words,express,
The,manner,of,my,pity-wanting,pain,

For,if,I,should,despair,I,should,grow,mad,
And,in,my,madness,might,speak,ill,of,thee,
Now,this,ill-wresting,world,is,grown,so,bad,
Mad,slanderers,by,mad,ears,believed,be,

In,faith,I,do,not,love,thee,with,mine,eyes,
For,they,in,thee,a,thousand,errors,note,
But,'t,is,my,heart,that,loves,what,they,despise,
Who,in,despite,of,view,is,pleased,to,dote,

But,my,five,wits,nor,my,five,senses,can,
Dissuade,one,foolish,heart,from,serving,thee,
Who,leaves,unswayed,the,likeness,of,a,man,
Thy,proud,heart,'s,slave,and,vassal,wretch,to,be,

Love,is,my,sin,and,thy,dear,virtue,hate,
Hate,of,my,sin,grounded,on,sinful,loving,
O,but,with,mine,compare,thou,thine,own,state,
And,thou,shalt,find,it,merits,not,reproving,

Be,it,lawful,I,love,thee,as,thou,lov'st,those,
Whom,thine,eyes,woo,as,mine,importune,thee,
Root,pity,in,thy,heart,that,when,it,grows,
Thy,pity,may,deserve,to,pitied,be,

Lo,as,a,careful,huswife,runs,to,catch,
One,of,her,feathered,creatures,broke,away,
Sets,down,her,babe,and,makes,all,swift,dispatch,
In,pursuit,of,the,thing,she,would,have,stay,

So,run'st,thou,after,that,which,flies,from,thee,
Whilst,I,thy,babe,chase,thee,afar,behind,
But,if,thou,catch,thy,hope,turn,back,to,me,
And,play,the,mother,'s,part,kiss,me,be,kind,

Two,loves,I,have,of,comfort,and,despair,
Which,like,two,spirits,do,suggest,me,still,
The,better,angel,is,a,man,right,fair,
The,worser,spirit,a,woman,coloured,ill,

And,whether,that,my,angel,be,turned,fiend,
Suspect,I,may,yet,not,directly,tell,
But,being,both,from,me,both,to,each,friend,
I,guess,one,angel,in,another,'s,hell,

Those,lips,that,Love,'s,own,hand,did,make,
Breathed,forth,the,sound,that,said,'I,hate,,,
To,me,that,languished,for,her,sake,
But,when,she,saw,my,woeful,state,

'I,hate,she,altered,with,an,end,
That,followed,it,as,gentle,day,
Doth,follow,night,who,like,a,fiend,
From,heaven,to,hell,is,flown,away,

Poor,soul,the,centre,of,my,sinful,earth,
My,sinful,earth,these,rebel,powers,array,
Why,dost,thou,pine,within,and,suffer,dearth,
Painting,thy,outward,walls,so,costly,gay,

Then,soul,live,thou,upon,thy,servant,'s,loss,
And,let,that,pine,to,aggravate,thy,store,
Buy,terms,divine,in,selling,hours,of,dross,
Within,be,fed,without,be,rich,no,more,

My,love,is,as,a,fever,longing,still,
For,that,which,longer,nurseth,the,disease,
Feeding,on,that,which,doth,preserve,the,ill,
Th,uncertain,sickly,appetite,to,please,

Past,cure,I,am,now,reason,is,past,care,
And,frantic-mad,with,evermore,unrest,
My,thoughts,and,my,discourse,as,mad,men,'s,are,
At,random,from,the,truth,vainly,expressed,

O,me,what,eyes,hath,love,put,in,my,head,
Which,have,no,correspondence,with,true,sight,
Or,if,they,have,where,is,my,judgment,fled,
That,censures,falsely,what,they,see,aright,

How,can,it,O,how,can,love,'s,eye,be,true,
That,is,so,vexed,with,watching,and,with,tears,
No,marvel,then,though,I,mistake,my,view,
The,sun,it,self,sees,not,till,heaven,clears,

Canst,thou,O,cruel,say,I,love,thee,not,
When,I,against,my,self,with,thee,partake,
Do,I,not,think,on,thee,when,I,forgot,
Am,of,my,self,all-tyrant,for,thy,sake,

What,merit,do,I,in,my,self,respect,
That,is,so,proud,thy,service,to,despise,
When,all,my,best,doth,worship,thy,defect,
Commanded,by,the,motion,of,thine,eyes,

O,from,what,power,hast,thou,this,powerful,might,
With,insufficiency,my,heart,to,sway,
To,make,me,give,the,lie,to,my,true,sight,
And,swear,that,brightness,doth,not,grace,the,day,

Who,taught,thee,how,to,make,me,love,thee,more,
The,more,I,hear,and,see,just,cause,of,hate,
O,though,I,love,what,others,do,abhor,
With,others,thou,shouldst,not,abhor,my,state,

Love,is,too,young,to,know,what,conscience,is,
Yet,who,knows,not,conscience,is,born,of,love,
Then,gentle,cheater,urge,not,my,amiss,
Lest,guilty,of,my,faults,thy,sweet,self,prove,

But,rising,at,thy,name,doth,point,out,thee,
As,his,triumphant,prize,proud,of,this,pride,
He,is,contented,thy,poor,drudge,to,be,
To,stand,in,thy,affairs,fall,by,thy,side,

In,loving,thee,thou,know'st,I,am,forsworn,
But,thou,art,twice,forsworn,to,me,love,swearing,
In,act,thy,bed-vow,broke,and,new,faith,torn,
In,vowing,new,hate,after,new,love,bearing,

For,I,have,sworn,deep,oaths,of,thy,deep,kindness,
Oaths,of,thy,love,thy,truth,thy,constancy,
And,to,enlighten,thee,gave,eyes,to,blindness,
Or,made,them,swear,against,the,thing,they,see,

Cupid,laid,by,his,brand,and,fell,asleep,
A,maid,of,Dian,'s,this,advantage,found,
And,his,love-kindling,fire,did,quickly,steep,
In,a,cold,valley-fountain,of,that,ground,

But,at,my,mistress,eye,Love,'s,brand,new-fired,
The,boy,for,trial,needs,would,touch,my,breast,
I,sick,withal,the,help,of,bath,desired,
And,thither,hied,a,sad,distempered,guest,

The,little,Love-god,lying,once,asleep,
Laid,by,his,side,his,heart-inflaming,brand,
Whilst,many,nymphs,that,vowed,chaste,life,to,keep,
Came,tripping,by,but,in,her,maiden,hand,

Happy,ye,leaves,when,as,those,lily,hands,
Which,hold,my,life,in,their,dead-doing,might,
Shall,handle,you,and,hold,in,love,'s,soft,bands,
Like,captives,trembling,at,the,victor,'s,sight,

And,happy,rhymes,bath,'d,in,the,sacred,brook,
Of,Helicon,whence,she,derived,is,
When,ye,behold,that,Angel,'s,blessed,look,
My,soul,'s,long-lacked,food,my,heaven,'s,bliss,

Unquiet,thought,whom,at,the,first,I,bred,
Of,th,inward,bale,of,my,love-pined,heart,
And,sithens,have,with,sighs,and,sorrows,fed,
Till,greater,then,my,womb,thou,woxen,art,

But,if,in,presence,of,that,fairest,proud,
Thou,chance,to,come,fall,lowly,at,her,feet,
And,with,meek,humbless,and,afflicted,mood,
Pardon,for,thee,and,grace,for,me,entreat,

Thou,sovereign,beauty,which,I,do,admire,
Witness,the,world,how,worthy,to,be,praised,
The,light,whereof,hath,kindled,heavenly,fire,
In,my,frail,spirit,by,her,from,baseness,raised,

So,when,my,tongue,would,speak,her,praises,due,
It,stopped,is,with,thought,'s,astonishment,
And,when,my,pen,would,write,her,titles,true,
It,ravished,is,with,fancy,'s,wonderment,

New,year,forth,looking,out,of,Janus,gate,
Doth,seem,to,promise,hope,of,new,delight,
And,bidding,th,old,Adieu,his,passed,date,
Bids,all,old,thoughts,to,die,in,dumpish,sprite,

For,lusty,spring,now,in,his,timely,hour,
Is,ready,to,come,forth,him,to,receive,
And,warns,the,Earth,with,diverse,colored,flower,
To,deck,herself,and,her,fair,mantle,weave,

Rudely,thou,wrongest,my,dear,heart,'s,desire,
In,finding,fault,with,her,too,portly,pride,
The,thing,which,I,do,most,in,her,admire,
Is,of,the,world,unworthy,most,envied,

Such,pride,is,praise,such,portliness,is,honor,
That,boldened,innocence,bears,in,her,eyes,
And,her,fair,countenance,like,a,goodly,banner,
Spreads,in,defiance,of,all,enemies,

Be,not,dismayed,that,her,unmoved,mind,
Doth,still,persist,in,her,rebellious,pride,
And,love,not,like,to,lusts,of,baser,kind,
The,harder,won,the,firmer,will,abide,

So,hard,it,is,to,kindle,new,desire,
In,gentle,breast,that,shall,endure,for,ever,
Deep,is,the,wound,that,dints,the,parts,entire,
With,chaste,affects,that,naught,but,death,can,sever,

Fair,eyes,the,mirror,of,my,mazed,heart,
What,wondrous,virtue,is,contained,in,you,
The,which,both,life,and,death,forth,from,you,dart,
Into,the,object,of,your,mighty,view,

But,since,that,life,is,more,than,death,desired,
Look,ever,lovely,as,becomes,you,best,
That,your,bright,beams,of,my,weak,eyes,admired,
May,kindle,living,fire,within,my,breast,

More,than,most,fair,full,of,the,living,fire,
Kindled,above,unto,the,maker,near,
No,eyes,but,joys,in,which,all,powers,conspire,
That,to,the,world,naught,else,be,counted,dear,

You,frame,my,thoughts,and,fashion,me,within,
You,stop,my,tongue,and,teach,my,heart,to,speak,
You,calm,the,storm,that,passion,did,begin,
Strong,through,your,cause,but,by,your,virtue,weak,

Long-while,I,sought,to,what,I,might,compare,
Those,powerful,eyes,which,lighten,my,dark,sprite,
Yet,find,I,nought,on,earth,to,which,I,dare,
Resemble,th'image,of,their,goodly,light,

Nor,to,the,lightening,for,they,still,persever,
Nor,to,the,diamond,for,they,are,more,tender,
Nor,unto,crystal,for,nought,may,them,sever,
Nor,unto,glass,such,baseness,mought,offend,her,

Unrighteous,lord,of,love,what,law,is,this,
That,me,thou,makest,thus,tormented,be,
The,whiles,she,lordeth,in,licentious,bliss,
Of,her,freewill,scorning,both,thee,and,me,

But,her,proud,heart,do,thou,a,little,shake,
And,that,high,look,with,which,she,doth,comptroll,
All,this,world,'s,pride,bow,to,a,baser,make,
And,all,her,faults,in,thy,black,book,enroll,

Daily,when,I,do,seek,and,sew,for,peace,
And,hostages,do,offer,for,my,truth,
She,cruel,warrior,doth,herself,address,
To,battle,and,the,weary,war,renew'th,

Yet,my,poor,life,all,sorrows,to,assoyle,
I,would,her,yield,her,wrath,to,pacify,
But,then,she,seeks,with,torment,and,turmoil,
To,force,me,live,and,will,not,let,me,die,

One,day,I,sought,with,her,heart-thrilling,eyes,
To,make,a,truce,and,terms,to,entertain,
All,fearless,then,of,so,false,enemies,
Which,sought,me,to,entrap,in,treason,'s,train,

Too,feeble,I,t'abide,the,brunt,so,strong,
Was,forced,to,yield,myself,into,their,hands,
Who,me,captiving,straight,with,rigorous,wrong,
Have,ever,since,me,kept,in,cruel,bands,

In,that,proud,port,which,her,so,goodly,graceth,
Whiles,her,fair,face,she,rears,up,to,the,sky,
And,to,the,ground,her,eyelids,low,embaseth,
Most,goodly,temperature,ye,may,descry,

But,that,same,lofty,countenance,seems,to,scorn,
Base,thing,and,think,how,she,to,heaven,may,climb,
Treading,down,earth,as,lothsome,and,forlorn,
That,hinders,heavenly,thoughts,with,drossy,slime,

Return,again,my,forces,late,dismayed,
Unto,the,siege,by,you,abondon,'d,quite,
Great,shame,it,is,to,leave,like,one,afraid,
So,fair,a,peace,for,one,repulse,so,light,

Bring,therefore,all,the,forces,that,ye,may,
And,lay,incessant,battery,to,her,heart,
Plaints,prayers,vows,ruth,sorrow,and,dismay,
Those,engines,can,the,proudest,love,convert,

Ye,tradefull,Merchants,that,with,weary,toil,
Do,seek,most,precious,things,to,make,your,gain,
And,both,the,Indias,of,their,treasures,spoil,
What,needeth,you,to,seek,so,far,in,vain,

If,pearls,her,teeth,be,pearls,both,pure,and,round,
If,ivory,her,forhead,ivory,weene,
If,gold,her,locks,are,finest,gold,on,ground,
If,silver,her,fair,hands,are,silver,sheen,

One,day,as,I,unwarily,did,gaze,
On,those,fair,eyes,my,love,'s,immortal,light,
The,whiles,my,'stonished,heart,stood,in,amaze,
Through,sweet,illusion,of,her,look,'s,delight,

One,of,those,archers,closely,I,did,spy,
Aiming,his,arrow,at,my,very,heart,
When,suddenly,with,twinkle,of,her,eye,
The,Damsel,broke,his,misintended,dart,

The,glorious,portrait,of,that,Angel,'s,face,
Made,to,amaze,weak,men,'s,confused,skill,
And,this,world,'s,worthless,glory,to,embase,
What,pen,what,pencil,can,express,her,fill,

The,sweet,eye-glances,that,like,arrows,glide,
The,charming,smiles,that,rob,sense,from,the,heart,
The,lovely,pleasance,and,the,lofty,pride,
Can,not,expressed,be,by,any,art,

The,rolling,wheel,that,runneth,often,round,
The,hardest,steel,in,tract,of,time,doth,tear,
And,drizling,drops,that,often,do,redound,
The,firmest,flint,doth,in,continuance,wear,

But,when,I,plead,she,bids,me,play,my,part,
And,when,I,weep,she,says,tears,are,but,water,
And,when,I,sigh,she,says,I,know,the,art,
And,when,I,wail,she,turns,herself,to,laughter,

The,merry,cuckoo,messenger,of,spring,
His,trumpet,shrill,hath,thrice,already,sounded,
That,warns,all,lovers,wait,upon,their,king,
Who,now,is,coming,forth,with,garland,crowned,

But,'mongst,them,all,which,did,Love,'s,honor,raise,
No,word,was,heard,of,her,that,most,it,ought,
But,she,his,precept,proudly,disobeys,
And,doth,his,idle,message,set,at,nought,

In,vain,I,seek,and,sue,to,her,for,grace,
And,do,mine,humbled,heart,before,her,pour,
The,whiles,her,foot,she,in,my,neck,doth,place,
And,tread,my,life,down,in,the,lowly,floor,

But,she,more,cruel,and,more,savage,wild,
Then,either,lion,or,lioness,
Shames,not,to,be,with,guiltless,blood,defiled,
But,taketh,glory,in,her,cruelness,

Was,it,the,work,of,nature,or,of,art,
Which,tempered,so,the,feature,of,her,face,
That,pride,and,meekness,mixed,by,equal,part,
Do,both,appear,t'adorn,her,beauty,'s,grace,

With,such,strange,terms,her,eyes,she,doth,inure,
That,with,one,look,she,doth,my,life,dismay,
And,with,another,doth,it,straight,recure,
Her,smile,me,draws,her,frown,me,drives,away,

This,holy,season,fit,to,fast,and,pray,
Men,to,devotion,ought,to,be,inclined,
Therefore,I,likewise,on,so,holy,day,
For,my,sweet,Saint,some,service,fit,will,find,

There,I,to,her,as,th'author,of,my,bliss,
Will,build,an,altar,to,appease,her,ire,
And,on,the,same,my,heart,will,sacrifice,
Burning,in,flames,of,pure,and,chaste,desire,

Penelope,for,her,Ulysses,sake,
Devised,a,web,her,wooers,to,deceive,
In,which,the,work,that,she,all,day,did,make,
The,same,at,night,she,did,again,unreave,

So,when,I,think,to,end,that,I,begun,
I,must,begin,and,never,bring,to,end,
For,with,one,look,she,spills,that,long,I,spun,
And,with,one,word,my,whole,year,'s,work,doth,rend,

When,I,behold,that,beauty,'s,wonderment,
And,rare,perfection,of,each,goodly,part,
Of,nature,'s,skill,the,only,complement,
I,honor,and,admire,the,maker,'s,art,

Whom,all,the,Gods,in,council,did,agree,
Into,this,sinful,world,from,heaven,to,send,
That,she,to,wicked,men,a,scourge,should,be,
For,all,their,faults,with,which,they,did,offend,

How,long,shall,this,like,dying,life,endure,
And,know,no,end,of,her,own,mystery,
But,waste,and,wear,away,in,terms,unsure,
'Twixt,fear,and,hope,depending,doubtfully,

But,yet,if,in,your,hardened,breast,ye,hide,
A,close,intent,at,last,to,show,me,grace,
Then,all,the,woes,and,wrecks,which,I,abide,
As,means,of,bliss,I,gladly,will,embrace,

Sweet,is,the,rose,but,grows,upon,a,briar,
Sweet,in,the,Juniper,but,sharp,his,bough,
Sweet,is,the,Eglantine,but,pricketh,near,
Sweet,is,the,firbloom,but,his,branches,rough,

So,every,sweet,with,sour,is,tempered,still,
That,maketh,it,be,coveted,the,more,
For,easy,things,that,may,be,got,at,will,
Most,sorts,of,men,do,set,but,little,store,

Fair,proud,now,tell,me,why,should,fair,be,proud,
Sith,all,world,'s,glory,is,but,dross,unclean,
And,in,the,shade,of,death,itself,shall,shroud,
But,ever,now,thereof,ye,little,weene,

Ne,any,then,shall,after,it,inquire,
Ne,any,mention,shall,thereof,remain,
But,what,this,verse,that,never,shall,expire,
Shall,to,you,purchase,with,her,thankless,pain,

The,laurel,leaf,which,you,this,day,do,wear,
Gives,me,great,hope,of,your,relenting,mind,
For,since,it,is,the,badge,which,I,do,bear,
Ye,wearing,it,do,seem,to,me,inclined,

Proud,Daphne,scorning,Phoebus,lovely,fire,
On,the,Thessalian,shore,from,him,did,fly,
For,which,the,gods,in,their,revengeful,ire,
Did,her,transform,into,a,laurel,tree,

See,how,the,stubborn,damsel,doth,deprave,
My,simple,meaning,with,disdainful,scorn,
And,by,the,bay,which,I,unto,her,gave,
Accounts,myself,her,captive,quite,forlorn,

But,sith,she,will,the,conquest,challenge,needs,
Let,her,accept,me,as,her,faithful,thrall,
That,her,great,triumph,which,my,skill,exceeds,
I,may,in,trump,of,fame,blaze,over,all,

My,love,is,like,to,ice,and,I,to,fire,
How,comes,it,then,that,this,her,cold,so,great,
Is,not,dissolved,through,my,so-hot,desire,
But,harder,grows,the,more,I,her,intreat,

What,more,miraculous,thing,may,be,told,
That,fire,which,all,things,melts,should,harden,ice,
And,ice,which,is,congealed,with,senseless,cold,
Should,kindle,fire,by,wonderful,device,

Ah,why,hath,nature,to,so,hard,a,heart,
Given,so,goodly,gifts,of,beauty,'s,grace,
Whose,pride,depraves,each,other,better,part,
And,all,those,pretty,ornaments,deface,

But,my,proud,one,doth,work,the,greater,scath,
Through,sweet,allurement,of,her,lovely,hue,
That,she,the,better,may,in,bloody,bath,
Of,such,poor,thralls,her,cruel,hands,embrew,

The,painful,smith,with,force,of,fervent,heat,
The,hardest,iron,soon,doth,mollify,
That,with,his,heavy,sledge,he,can,it,beat,
And,fashion,to,what,he,it,list,apply,

But,still,the,more,she,fervent,sees,my,fit,
The,more,she,frieseth,in,her,willful,pride,
And,harder,grows,the,harder,she,is,smit,
With,all,the,plaints,which,to,her,be,applied,

Great,wrong,I,do,I,can,it,not,deny,
To,that,most,sacred,empress,my,dear,dread,
Not,finishing,her,Queen,of,Fa,ed.ry,
That,mote,enlarge,her,living,praises,dead,

How,then,should,I,without,another,wit,
Think,ever,to,endure,so,tedious,toil,
Sins,that,this,one,is,tossed,with,troublous,fit,
Of,a,proud,love,that,both,my,spirit,spoil,

Like,a,ship,that,through,the,Ocean,wide,
By,conduct,of,some,star,doth,make,her,way,
Whenas,a,storm,hath,dimmed,her,trusty,guide,
Out,of,her,course,doth,wander,far,astray,

Yet,hope,I,well,that,when,this,storm,is,past,
My,Helice,the,lodestar,of,my,life,
Will,shine,again,and,look,on,me,at,last,
With,lovely,light,to,clear,my,cloudy,grief,

My,hungry,eyes,through,greedy,covetize,
Still,to,behold,the,object,of,their,pain,
With,no,contentment,can,themselves,suffice,
But,having,pine,and,having,not,complain,

Yet,are,mine,eyes,so,filled,with,the,store,
Of,that,fair,sight,that,nothing,else,they,brook,
But,loath,the,things,which,they,did,like,before,
And,can,no,more,endure,on,them,to,look,

Tell,me,when,shall,these,weary,woes,have,end,
Or,shall,their,ruthless,torment,never,cease,
But,all,my,days,in,pining,langor,spend,
Without,hope,of,aswagement,or,release,

But,when,ye,have,shewed,all,extermities,
Then,think,how,little,glory,ye,have,gained,
By,slaying,him,whose,life,though,ye,dispise,
Mote,have,your,life,in,honour,long,maintained,

What,guile,is,this,that,those,her,golden,tresses,
She,doth,attire,under,a,net,of,gold,
And,with,sly,skill,so,cunningly,them,dresses,
That,which,is,gold,or,hair,may,scarce,be,told,

Take,heed,therefore,mine,eyes,how,ye,do,stare,
Henceforth,too,rashly,on,that,guileful,net,
In,which,if,ever,ye,entrapped,are,
Out,of,her,bands,ye,by,no,means,shall,get,

Arion,when,through,tempests,cruel,wrack,
He,forth,was,thrown,into,the,greedy,seas,
Through,the,sweet,music,which,his,harp,did,make,
Allured,a,dolphin,him,from,death,to,ease,

But,in,her,pride,she,doth,persever,still,
All,careless,how,my,life,for,her,decays,
Yet,with,one,word,she,can,in,save,or,spill,
To,spill,were,pitty,but,to,save,were,praise,

Sweet,smile,the,daughter,of,the,queen,of,love,
Expressing,all,thy,mother,'s,powerful,art,
With,which,she,wonts,to,temper,angry,Jove,
When,all,the,gods,he,threats,with,thund'ring,dart,

Whylest,rapt,with,joy,resembling,heavenly,madness,
My,soul,was,ravished,quite,as,in,a,trance,
And,feeling,thence,no,more,her,sorrow,'s,sadness,
Fed,on,the,fullness,of,that,cheerful,glance,

Mark,when,she,smiles,with,amiable,cheer,
And,tell,me,whereto,can,ye,liken,it,
When,on,each,eyelid,sweetly,do,appear,
An,hundred,Graces,as,in,shade,to,sit,

At,sight,whereof,each,bird,that,sits,on,spray,
And,every,beast,that,to,his,den,was,fled,
Comes,forth,afresh,out,of,their,late,dismay,
And,to,the,light,lift,up,their,drooping,head,

Is,it,her,nature,or,is,it,her,will,
To,be,so,cruel,to,an,humbled,foe,
If,nature,then,she,may,it,mend,with,skill,
If,will,then,she,at,will,may,will,forgo,

And,that,same,glorious,beauty,'s,idle,boast,
Is,but,a,bait,such,wretches,to,beguile,
As,being,long,in,her,love,'s,tempest,tossed,
She,means,at,last,to,make,her,piteous,spoil,

The,love,which,me,so,cruelly,tormenteth,
So,pleasing,is,in,my,extremest,pain,
That,all,the,more,my,sorrow,it,augmenteth,
The,more,I,love,and,do,embrace,my,bane,

The,which,that,it,from,her,may,never,start,
Let,her,if,please,her,bind,with,adamant,chain,
And,from,all,wandering,loves,which,mote,pervert,
His,safe,assurance,strongly,it,restrain,

Shall,I,then,silent,be,or,shall,I,speak,
And,if,I,speak,her,wrath,renew,I,shall,
And,if,I,silent,be,my,heart,will,break,
Or,choked,be,with,overflowing,gall,

Yet,I,my,heart,with,silence,secretly,
Will,teach,to,speak,and,my,just,cause,to,plead,
And,eke,mine,eyes,with,meek,humility,
Love-learned,letters,to,her,eyes,to,read,

When,those,renowned,noble,peers,of,Greece,
Through,stubborn,pride,amongst,themselves,did,war,
Forgetful,of,the,famous,golden,fleece,
Then,Orpheus,with,his,harp,their,strife,did,bar,

But,when,in,hand,my,tuneless,harp,I,take,
Then,do,I,more,augment,my,foes,despight,
And,grief,renew,and,passions,do,awake,
To,battle,fresh,against,myself,to,fight,

Leave,lady,in,your,glass,of,crystal,clean,
Your,goodly,self,for,evermore,to,view,
And,in,myself,my,inward,self,I,mean,
Most,lively,like,behold,your,semblance,true,

And,were,it,not,that,through,your,cruelty,
With,sorrow,dimmed,and,deformed,it,were,
The,goodly,image,of,your,visnomy,
Dearer,than,crystal,would,therein,appear,

When,my,abode,'s,prefixed,time,is,spent,
My,cruel,fair,straight,bids,me,wend,my,way,
But,then,from,heaven,most,hideous,storms,are,sent,
As,willing,me,against,her,will,to,stay,

But,ye,high,heavens,that,all,this,sorrow,see,
Sith,all,your,tempests,can,not,hold,me,back,
Aswage,your,storms,or,else,both,you,and,she,
Will,both,together,me,too,sorely,wrack,

Trust,not,the,treason,of,those,smiling,looks,
Until,ye,have,their,guilefull,trains,well,tried,
For,they,are,like,but,unto,golden,hooks,
That,from,the,foolish,fish,their,baits,do,hide,

Yet,even,whilst,her,bloody,hands,them,slay,
Her,eyes,look,lovely,and,upon,them,smile,
That,they,take,pleasure,in,her,cruel,play,
And,dying,do,themselves,of,pain,beguile,

Innocent,paper,whom,too,cruel,hand,
Did,make,the,matter,to,avenge,her,ire,
And,ere,she,could,thy,cause,well,understand,
Did,sacrifice,unto,the,greedy,fire,

Whom,she,all,careless,of,his,grief,contrained,
To,utter,forth,the,anguish,of,his,heart,
And,would,not,hear,when,he,to,her,complained,
The,piteous,passion,of,his,dying,smart,

Fair,cruel,why,are,you,so,fierce,and,cruel,
Is,it,because,your,eyes,have,power,to,kill,
Then,know,that,mercy,is,the,mightiest,jewel,
And,greater,glory,think,to,save,than,spill,

Let,them,feel,th'utmost,of,your,cruelties,
And,kill,with,looks,as,Cockatrices,do,
But,him,that,at,your,footstool,humbled,lies,
With,merciful,regard,give,mercy,to,

Long,languishing,in,double,malady,
Of,my,heart,'s,wound,and,of,my,body,'s,grief,
There,came,to,me,a,leach,that,would,apply,
Fit,medicines,for,my,body,'s,best,relief,

Then,with,some,cordials,seek,first,to,appease,
The,inward,langour,of,my,wounded,heart,
And,then,my,body,shall,have,shortly,ease,
But,such,sweet,cordials,pass,physicians,art,

Do,I,not,see,that,fairest,images,
Of,hardest,marble,are,of,purpose,made,
For,that,they,should,endure,through,many,ages,
Ne,let,their,famous,monuments,to,fade,

Ne,aught,so,hard,but,he,that,would,attend,
Mote,soften,it,and,to,his,will,allure,
So,do,I,hope,her,stubborn,heart,to,bend,
And,that,it,then,more,steadfast,will,endure,

So,oft,as,homeward,I,from,her,depart,
I,go,like,one,that,having,lost,the,field,
Is,prisoner,led,away,with,heavy,heart,
Despoiled,of,warlike,arms,and,knowen,shield,

There,let,no,thought,of,joy,or,pleasure,vain,
Dare,to,approach,that,may,my,solace,breed,
But,sudden,dumps,and,dreary,sad,disdain,
Of,all,worlds,gladness,more,my,torment,feed,

The,panther,knowing,that,his,spotted,hide,
Doth,please,all,beasts,but,that,his,looks,them,fray,
Within,a,bush,his,dreadful,head,doth,hide,
To,let,thm,gaze,whilst,he,on,them,may,prey,

Great,shame,it,is,thing,so,divine,in,view,
Made,for,to,be,the,world,'s,most,ornament,
To,make,the,bait,her,gazers,to,enbrew,
Good,shames,to,be,too,ill,an,instrument,

Of,this,world,'s,theatre,in,which,we,stay,
My,love,like,the,spectator,idly,sits,
Beholding,me,that,all,the,pageants,play,
Disguising,diversely,my,troubled,wits,

Yet,she,beholding,me,with,constant,eye,
Delights,not,in,my,mirth,nor,rues,my,smart,
But,when,I,laugh,she,mocks,and,when,I,cry,
She,laughs,and,hardens,evermore,her,heart,

So,oft,as,I,her,beauty,do,behold,
And,therewith,do,her,cruelty,compare,
I,marvel,of,what,substance,was,the,mould,
The,which,her,made,at,once,so,cruel,fair,

Then,needs,another,element,inquire,
Whereof,she,mote,be,made,that,is,the,sky,
For,to,the,heaven,her,haughty,looks,aspire,
And,eke,her,mind,is,pure,immortal,high,

Fair,ye,be,sure,but,cruel,and,unkind,
As,is,the,tiger,that,with,greediness,
Hunts,after,blood,when,he,by,chance,doth,find,
A,feeble,beast,doth,felly,him,oppress,

Fair,be,ye,sure,but,hard,and,obstinate,
As,is,a,rock,amidst,the,raging,floods,
'Gainst,which,a,ship,of,succour,desolate,
Doth,suffer,wreck,both,of,herself,and,goods,

Sweet,warrior,when,shall,I,have,peace,with,you,
High,time,it,is,this,war,now,ended,were,
Which,I,no,longer,can,endure,to,sue,
Ne,your,incessant,battery,more,to,bear,

Yet,shoot,ye,sharply,still,and,spare,me,not,
But,glory,think,to,make,these,cruel,stoures,
Ye,cruel,one,what,glory,can,be,got,
In,slaying,him,that,would,live,gladly,yours,

Thrice,happy,she,that,is,so,well,assured,
Unto,herself,and,settled,so,in,heart,
That,neither,will,for,better,be,allured,
Ne,feared,with,worse,to,any,chance,start,

Such,self,assurance,need,not,fear,the,spite,
Of,grudging,foes,ne,favor,seek,of,friends,
But,in,the,stay,of,her,own,steadfast,might,
Neither,to,one,herself,nor,another,bends,

They,that,in,course,of,heavenly,spheres,are,skilled,
To,every,planet,point,his,sundry,year,
In,which,her,circle,'s,voyage,is,fulfilled,
As,Mars,in,three-score,years,doth,run,his,sphere,

Then,by,that,count,which,lovers,books,invent,
The,sphere,of,Cupid,forty,years,contains,
Which,I,have,wasted,in,long,languishment,
That,seemed,the,longer,for,my,greater,pains,

The,glorious,image,of,the,maker,'s,beauty,
My,sovereign,saint,the,idol,of,my,thought,
Dare,not,henceforth,above,the,bounds,of,duty,
T'accuse,of,pride,or,rashly,blame,for,aught,

The,bud,of,joy,the,blossom,of,the,morn,
The,beam,of,light,whom,mortal,eyes,admire,
What,reason,is,it,then,but,she,should,scorn,
Base,things,that,to,her,love,too,bold,aspire,

The,weary,year,his,race,now,having,run,
The,new,begins,his,compassed,course,anew,
With,shew,of,morning,mild,he,hath,begun,
Betokening,peace,and,plenty,to,ensue,

Then,shall,the,new,year,'s,joy,forth,freshly,send,
Into,the,glooming,world,his,gladsome,ray,
And,all,these,storms,which,now,his,beauty,blend,
Shall,turn,to,calms,and,timely,clear,away,

After,long,storms,and,tempests,sad,assay,
Which,hardly,I,endured,heretofore,
In,dread,of,death,and,dangerous,dismay,
With,which,my,silly,bark,was,tossed,sore,

Most,happy,he,that,can,at,last,achieve,
The,joyous,safety,of,so,sweet,a,rest,
Whose,least,delight,sufficeth,to,deprive,
Remembrance,of,all,pains,which,him,oppressed,

Coming,to,kiss,her,lips,(,such,grace,I,found,
Me,seemed,I,smelled,a,garden,of,sweet,flowers,
That,dainty,odors,from,them,threw,around,
For,damsels,fit,to,deck,their,lovers,bowers,

Her,goodly,bosom,like,a,strawberry,bed,
Her,neck,like,to,a,bunch,of,Columbines,
Her,breast,like,Lillies,ere,their,leaves,be,shed,
Her,nipples,like,young,blossomed,Jasmines,

The,doubt,which,you,misdeem,fair,love,is,vain,
That,fondly,fear,to,lose,your,liberty,
When,losing,one,two,liberties,you,gain,
And,make,him,bond,that,bondage,erst,did,fly,

There,pride,dare,not,approach,nor,discord,spill,
The,league,'twixt,them,that,loyal,love,hath,bound,
But,simple,truth,and,mutual,good,will,
Seeks,with,sweet,peace,to,salve,each,others,wound,

To,all,those,happy,blissing,which,ye,have,
With,plenteous,hand,by,heaven,upon,you,thrown,
This,one,disparagement,they,to,you,gave,
That,ye,your,love,lent,to,so,mean,a,one,

But,ye,thereby,much,greater,glory,gate,
Than,had,ye,sorted,with,a,prince,'s,peer,
For,now,your,light,doth,more,itself,dilate,
And,in,my,darkness,greater,doth,appear,

Like,as,a,huntsman,after,weary,chase,
Seeing,the,game,from,him,escaped,away,
Sits,down,to,rest,him,in,some,shady,place,
With,panting,hounds,beguiled,of,their,pray,

There,she,beholding,me,with,milder,look,
Sought,not,to,fly,but,fearless,still,did,bide,
Till,I,in,hand,her,yet,half-trembling,took,
And,with,her,own,goodwill,here,firmly,tied,

Most,glorious,Lord,of,life,that,on,this,day,
Didst,make,thy,triumph,over,death,and,sin,
And,having,harrowed,hell,didst,bring,away,
Captivity,thence,captive,us,to,win,

And,that,thy,love,we,weighing,worthily,
May,likewise,love,thee,for,the,same,again,
And,for,thy,sake,that,all,like,dear,didst,buy,
With,love,may,one,another,entertain,

The,famous,warriors,of,the,antick,world,
Used,trophies,to,erect,in,stately,wise,
In,which,they,would,the,records,have,enrolled,
Of,their,great,deeds,and,valorous,emprize,

Even,this,verse,vowed,to,eternity,
Shall,be,thereof,immortal,monument,
And,tell,her,praise,to,all,posterity,
That,may,admire,such,world,'s,rare,wonderment,

Fresh,spring,the,herald,of,love,'s,might,king,
In,whose,coat-armor,richly,are,displayed,
All,sorts,of,flowers,the,which,on,earth,do,spring,
In,goodly,colors,gloriously,displayed,

Bid,her,therefore,herself,soon,ready,make,
To,wait,on,love,amongst,his,lovely,crew,
Where,every,one,that,misseth,than,her,make,
Shall,be,by,him,amearst,with,penance,due,

I,joy,to,see,how,in,your,drawen,work,
Yourself,unto,the,bee,ye,do,compare,
And,me,unto,the,Spider,that,doth,lurk,
In,close,await,to,catch,her,unaware,

But,as,your,work,is,woven,all,above,
With,woodbine,flowers,and,fragrant,Eglantine,
So,sweet,your,prison,you,in,time,shall,prove,
With,many,dear,delights,bedecked,fine,

Oft,when,my,spirit,doth,spread,her,bolder,wings,
In,mind,to,mount,up,to,the,purest,sky,
It,down,is,weighed,with,thought,of,earthly,things,
And,clogged,with,burden,of,mortality,

There,my,frail,fancy,fed,with,full,delight,
Doth,bathe,in,bliss,and,mantleth,most,at,ease,
Ne,thinks,of,other,heaven,but,how,it,might,
Her,heart,'s,desire,with,most,contentment,please,

Being,myself,captured,here,in,care,
My,heart,whom,none,with,servile,bands,can,tie,
But,the,fair,tresses,of,your,golden,hair,
Breaking,his,prison,forth,to,you,doth,fly,

Do,you,him,take,and,in,your,bosom,bright,
Gently,encage,that,he,may,be,your,thrall,
Perhaps,he,there,may,learn,with,rare,delight,
To,sing,your,name,and,praises,over,all,

Most,happy,letters,fram,'d,by,skillful,trade,
With,which,that,happy,name,was,first,designed,
The,which,three,times,thrice,happy,hath,me,made,
With,gifts,of,body,fortune,and,of,mind,

The,third,my,love,my,life,'s,last,ornament,
By,whom,my,spirit,out,of,dust,was,raised,
To,speak,her,praise,and,glory,excellent,
Of,all,alive,most,worthy,to,be,praised,

One,day,I,wrote,her,name,upon,the,strand,
But,came,the,waves,and,washed,it,away,
Again,I,wrote,it,with,a,second,hand,
But,came,the,tide,and,made,my,pains,his,prey,

No,so,(,quod,I,let,baser,things,devise,
To,die,in,dust,but,you,shall,live,by,fame,
My,verse,your,virtues,rare,shall,eternize,
And,in,the,heavens,write,your,glorious,name,

Fair,bosom,fraught,with,virtue,'s,riches,treasure,
The,nest,of,love,the,lodging,of,delight,
The,bower,of,bliss,the,paradise,of,pleasure,
The,sacred,harbour,of,that,heavenly,sprite,

And,twixt,her,paps,like,early,fruit,in,May,
Whose,harvest,seemed,to,hasten,now,apace,
They,loosly,did,their,wanton,wings,display,
And,there,to,rest,themselves,did,boldly,place,

Was,it,a,dream,or,did,I,see,it,plain,
A,goodly,table,of,pure,ivory,
All,spread,with,juncats,fit,to,entertain,
The,greatest,prince,with,pompous,royalty,

Exceeding,sweet,yet,void,of,sinful,vice,
That,many,sought,yet,none,could,ever,taste,
Sweet,fruit,of,pleasure,brought,from,paradise,
By,love,himself,and,in,his,garden,placed,

Lacking,my,love,I,go,from,place,to,place,
Like,a,young,fawn,that,late,hath,lost,the,hind,
And,seek,each,where,where,last,I,saw,her,face,
Whose,image,yet,I,carry,fresh,in,mind,

But,when,mine,eyes,I,thereunto,direct,
They,idly,back,return,to,me,again,
And,when,I,hope,to,see,their,true,object,
I,find,myself,but,fed,with,fancies,vain,

Men,call,you,fair,and,you,do,credit,it,
For,that,yourself,ye,daily,such,do,see,
But,the,true,fair,that,is,the,gentle,wit,
And,virtuous,mind,is,much,more,prayed,of,me,

That,is,true,beauty,that,doth,argue,you,
To,be,divine,and,born,of,heavenly,seed,
Deriv,'d,from,that,fair,spirit,from,whom,all,true,
And,perfect,beauty,did,at,first,proceed,

After,so,long,a,race,as,I,have,run,
Through,Faery,land,which,those,six,books,compile,
Give,leave,to,rest,me,being,half,fordone,
And,gather,to,myself,new,breath,awhile,

Till,then,give,leave,to,me,in,pleasant,mew,
To,sport,my,muse,and,sing,my,love,'s,sweet,praise,
The,contemplation,of,whose,heavenly,hue,
My,spirit,to,an,higher,pitch,will,raise,

Fair,is,my,love,when,her,fair,golden,heares,
With,the,loose,wind,ye,waving,chance,to,mark,
Fair,when,the,rose,in,her,red,cheeks,appears,
Or,in,her,eyes,the,fire,of,love,does,spark,

But,fairest,she,when,so,she,doth,display,
The,gate,with,pearls,and,rubies,richly,dight,
Through,which,her,words,so,wise,do,make,their,way,
To,bear,the,message,of,her,gentle,sprite,

Joy,of,my,life,full,oft,for,loving,you,
I,bless,my,lot,that,was,so,lucky,placed,
But,then,the,more,your,own,mishap,I,rue,
That,are,so,much,by,so,mean,love,debased,

But,since,ye,deigned,so,goodly,to,relent,
To,me,your,thrall,in,whom,is,little,worth,
That,little,that,I,am,shall,all,be,spent,
In,setting,your,immoral,praises,forth,

My,hungry,eyes,through,greedy,covetize,
Still,to,behold,the,object,of,their,pain,
With,no,contentment,can,themselves,suffice,
But,having,pine,and,having,not,complain,

Yet,are,mine,eyes,so,filled,with,the,store,
Of,that,fair,sight,that,nothing,else,they,brook,
But,loath,the,things,which,they,did,like,before,
And,can,no,more,endure,on,them,to,look,

Let,not,one,spark,of,filthy,lustfull,fire,
Ne,one,light,glance,of,sensual,desire,
Attempt,to,work,her,gentle,mind,'s,unrest,
But,pure,affections,bred,in,spotless,breast,

The,which,myself,could,never,yet,attain,
But,speak,no,word,to,her,of,these,sad,plights,
Which,her,too,constant,stiffness,doth,constrain,
Only,behold,her,rare,perfection,

The,world,that,can,not,deem,of,worthy,things,
When,I,do,praise,her,say,I,do,but,flatter,
So,does,the,cuckoo,when,the,mavis,sings,
Begin,his,witless,note,apace,to,clatter,

Deep,in,the,closet,of,my,parts,entire,
Her,worth,is,written,with,a,golden,quill,
That,me,with,heavenly,fury,doth,inspire,
And,my,glad,mouth,with,her,sweet,praises,fill,

Venemous,tongue,tipped,with,vile,adders,sting,
Of,that,self,kind,with,which,the,Furies,fell,
Their,snaky,heads,do,comb,from,which,a,spring,
Of,poisoned,words,and,spiteful,speeches,well,

The,sparks,whereof,let,kindle,thine,own,fire,
And,catching,hold,on,thine,own,wicked,head,
Consume,thee,quite,that,didst,with,guile,conspire,
In,my,sweet,peace,such,breaches,to,have,bred,

Since,I,did,leave,the,presence,of,my,love,
Many,long,weary,days,have,I,outworn,
And,many,nights,that,slowly,seemed,to,move,
Their,sad,protract,from,evening,until,morn,

Thus,I,the,time,with,expectation,spend,
And,fain,my,grief,with,changes,to,beguile,
That,further,seems,his,term,still,to,extend,
And,maketh,every,minute,seem,a,mile,

Since,I,have,lacked,the,comfort,of,that,light,
The,which,was,wont,to,lead,my,thoughts,astray,
I,wander,as,in,darkness,of,the,night,
Afraid,of,every,danger,'s,least,dismay,

Of,which,beholding,the,idea,plain,
Through,contemplation,of,my,purest,part,
With,light,thereof,I,do,myself,sustain,
And,thereon,feed,my,love-afamished,heart,

Like,as,the,culver,on,the,bared,bough,
Sits,mourning,for,the,absence,of,her,mate,
And,in,her,songs,sends,many,a,wishful,vow,
For,his,return,that,seems,to,linger,late,
